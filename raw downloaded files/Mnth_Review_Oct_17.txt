REMINDER: ABSTRACT DEADLINE 1st OCTOBER
The 2017 ASAB Winter meeting (Thursday 7th and
Friday 8th December 2017):
Sexual selection: do we still need to test the alterna-
tives?
Organised by Professor Nina Wedell and Dr David
Shuker
ABSTRACT SUBMISSION NOW OPEN: DEADLINE
1st OCTOBER
The 30 years since the publication of Bradbury and
Andersson's landmark \Sexual selection: testing the
alternatives" has seen a wealth of new empirical data on
the mechanisms and patterns of sexual selection, along-
side major theoretical advances. However, some key
concerns remain, including what drives the evolution of
mate choice and how sexual selection and natural selec-
tion interact. Moreover, the very denition of sexualselection remains contested. In this meeting, we will
explore the latest ndings in sexual selection, in terms
of both theory and experiment, to chart our progress
in understanding this most beguiling of evolutionary
mechanisms, and to map the way forward for the next
generation of sexual selection researchers.
Our invited speakers are Suzanne Alonzo, David Hosken,
and Hope Klug, and we are also delighted that Chris-
tine Nicol will be presenting the 2017 Tinbergen Lecture
during the meeting. We invite spoken and poster pre-
sentations encompassing the widest range of current
work on sexual selection. Please note that due to space
constraints, poster space will unfortunately be limited.
The meeting will be held at the Zoological Society of
London, Huxley Lecture Theatre, London Zoo. As is
traditional for the ASAB winter meeting, there is no
registration and delegates need to organise their own
accommodation and main meals. Tea and coee will
be provided both days, along with a wine reception on
the evening of the 7th. We welcome those wishing to
indicate their likely attendance however, and we are very
pleased to announce that abstract submissions for spo-
ken and poster presentations is now open (deadline 1st
October 2017). An abstract submission form is available
on our website: http://asabwinter2017.weebly.com/ andOctober 1, 2017 EvolDir 3
only submissions using this form will be accepted. Pre-
sentations will be chosen blind to author(s) and host
institution(s).
For further details, please visit our website (http://-

19th YOUNG SYSTEMATISTS' FORUM
Friday, 1 December 2017, 9:30 am
Venue: Flett Lecture Theatre,
Natural History Museum, London, UK
The annual Young Systematists' Forum represents an
exciting setting for Masters, PhD and young postdoc-
toral researchers to present their data, often for the rst
time, to a scientic audience interested in taxonomy,
systematics and phylogenetics. This well-established
event provides an important opportunity for budding
systematists to discuss their research in front of their
peers within a supportive environment. Supervisors and
other established systematists are also encouraged to
attend.
Prizes will be awarded for the most promising oral and
poster presentation as judged by a small panel on the
day.October 1, 2017 EvolDir 5
Registration is FREE.
Send applications by e-mail to
YSF.SystematicsAssociation@gmail.com , supply-
ing your name, contact address and stating whether
or not you wish to give an oral or poster presentation.
Please also tell us your academic stage - e.g., Masters,
PhD or postdoc. Space will be allocated subject to
availability and for a balanced programme of animal,
plant, algal, microbial, molecular and other research.
Non-presenting attendees are also very welcome - please
register as above.
Again the YSF will be held the day after
the Molluscan Forum (http://www.malacsoc.org.uk/-
MolluscanForum.htm) also at the Natural History Mu-
seum. This has been arranged so both meetings can be
attended, although if attending both you will have to
register for both meetings separately.
Abstracts must be submitted by e-mail in English and
in Word format no later than Friday 3 November 2017.
The body text should not exceed 150 words in length.
Title, authors, and their professional aliations should
be included with the abstracts. If the presentation is co-
authored, the actual speaker (oral) or presenter (poster)
must be clearly indicated in BOLD text.
If you have presented a talk at the YSF before, we
ask that you submit only for a poster presentation, as
speaker slots are limited and we want to give as many
people a chance as possible. Similarly, if you are pre-
senting at both the YSF and MF, we ask that you not
apply for speaking slots in both (or let us know so we
can assess).
All registered attendants will receive further informa-
tion about the meeting, including abstracts, by e-
mail one week in advance. This information will also
be displayed on the Systematics Association website
(www.systass.org).

Call for Abstracts Conference Human Enhancement
and Evolution Scientic, Technological, Policy & ELS
Considerations Lisbon 13- 14th December 2017 Host
Institution: Centre for Philosophy of Science of the Uni-
versity of Lisbon (CFCUL) [http://cfcul.fc.ul.pt/] The
Conference will have two parts:
1. Evolution and the Sciences and Technologies of Hu-
man Enhancement
Organismal dynamics are such that organisms incontro-
vertibly aect the very evolutionary pressures that shape
them, even if only indirectly. But seemingly, amongst
all organisms and perhaps owing to their cognitive evo-
lution, humans became exceptionally ne controllers
of both theirs and other organisms' evolutionary pro-
cesses. In virtue of the sciences and technologies of
human enhancement, more eective exertion of control
over evolution is nowadays becoming evident, and this
is shown among others by the rise of new technics such
as genetic editing tools. However, human enhancement
and its broad evolutionary eects are still understudied.
We invite contributions to the eort of understanding
the plethora of ways in which evolution relates to human
enhancement. As such, topics of interest may include,
but are not limited to:
* The human evolutionary possibilities: predictive mod-
els, challenges and limitations; * Directed evolution,
both gene driven (e.g. genetic engineering, inducedOctober 1, 2017 EvolDir 9
mutagenesis, and reprogenetics) or non-germline based;
* Evolutionary trade-os of assisted modes of human
reproduction, immunity engineering, medical and health
technologies, and of longevity enhancements (interfer-
ences in senescence and lifespan), their demographics
and population dynamics; * Natural and articially in-
duced reticulate evolution (e.g. human-non- human
transgenesis); * Present & future human evolution (e.g.
k-selection and speciation); * The impact of technologi-
cal evolution qua niche construction on human evolution
and ecology (e.g. geoengineering; non-Earth- bounded
evolution); * Non-carbon-based evolution (including AIs
of all kinds & alien); * The evolution of 4E and scaf-
folded cognition; * The relation between tness and
human enhancement (e.g. does human enhancement
enhance tness?); * Working denitions of \human en-
hancement" for Evolutionary Theories; * Is there actual
control over evolution? How could we understand it?
* Human evolution in relation to Technology evolution
(e.g. human- machine interfaces);

2. Policy & ELSA of Genome Editing and Human
Enhancement
Genome editing is a technology with the potential to pro-
mote and enhance health, and understand disease. How-
ever, as many other disruptive advances in science, it also
brings challenges at an ethical, legal, social, and political
level, particularly regarding the treatment of hereditary
diseases and the integrity of the human germline. The
possibilities of genome-editing and its limits and con-
sequences, specically to therapeutic applications and
targeted interventions in ecosystems are being broadly
discussed by many. It will be important to contribute
to the debate in a critical and transparent way with the
participation of scientists, society and policy-makers.
This will provide a platform to better assess the benets
and potential risks of the technology to help support
the development of sound policies in the future.
We invite reections upon the following themes (includ-
ing but not limited to):
Ethical, legal, political and social challenges associated
with genome-editing;
* Genetic editing: evolution of technology and medicine
and its implications for human health, and the natural
environment; * Socio-ethical and policy-related ques-
tions about the acceptability of germline modication; *
Challenges on dening \Genetic identity", parenthood
and respective responsibilities: limits and consequences;* \Human enhancement" potential of genetic editing: Im-
plications and scientic- technological feasibility thereof;
* Responses to the challenge of established norms.

The eld of crustacean genetics has undergone an ex-
citing revolution in recent years. The advancement of
sequencing technologies and methods has transformed
the way carcinologists ask questions and collect data,
especially for non-model organisms that lack genomic
references. For several groups within Crustacea, this
\genomic revolution" is still in its infancy. The potentialto capitalize on recent technology is great, and ndings
from these studies will lead to unprecedented insights
into the elds of evolutionary biology and molecular
ecology.
For this session, we would like to invite researchers
working in the eld of crustacean genetics/genomics.
We welcome contributions from phylogenetics/omics,
population genomics, transcriptomics, among others. In
addition to the abovementioned, theoretical and method-
ological talks will be considered.
We hope to highlight a diverse group of organisms that
span various elds of crustacean biology. Please indicate
that you would like to be included in the \Molecular
Insights" session.
We do not plan to publish a special issue.
We do not plan to apply for funding to recruit specic
speakers.
The session will accept as many talk proposals as ap-
propriate based on submitted abstracts.
We look forward to seeing you in DC!

The summary and objectives of the project
Posthitis (necrotic inamation of the prepuce) is a se-
vere disease of the European bison, which aects approx.
6 % of males a year. The disease is incurable and the
aected animals are usually eliminated or otherwise
the disease leads to penis autoamputation and death.
The etiology of posthitis is unknown but recent studies
on European bison using cattle tools indicated signif-
icant associations between certain cattle markers and
the occurence of the disease. A study by Olenski et al.
(2015) has shown the existence of genetic background of
posthitis in the European bison but the cross - species
character of their study did not allow to either indicate
the genes and their variants involved in the disease or
explain the mechanism if its inheritance.
Sequence - Based Genotyping (SBG) technique will al-
low to achieve an extensive amount of species-specic
data from the whole genome. European bison specic
markers will undergo genome wide association analysis
(GWAS) to identify markers, regions of chromosomes
and genes and their variants aecting susceptibility bi-
son on posthitis. The results will enable to design simple
genetic tests of the 20 - 30 most informative SNP mark-
ers detected. These tests will allow rapid and reliable
genotyping of bison susceptibility to posthitis and the
carriers of unfavourable genetic variants.
The aims of the project are:1. identication of the species specic SNPs (single
nucleotide polymorphisms markers) associated with pos-
tithis in the European bison
2. indication the genes and their variants, underlying
the development of posthitis in the European bison,
3. developing the model of the disease inheritance,
4. verication of the potential role of the Y chromosome
in the pathogenic process,
5.designing informative and cost-eective SNP -chip
based genetic test that allows verication of suscep-
tibility to posthitis as well as carriers of unfavorable
variants
We provide:
1. participation in an interesting scientic project;
2. work in a friendly research team, in a well-equipped
and organized biological laboratory with a support and
supervision of competent colleagues;
3. the possibility of eective scientic development
through cooperation with the best world research cen-
tres in the world;
4. possibility of extension the scholarship for subsequent
2 years;
5. possibility of additional funding through participation
in other research projects;
6. the possibility to apply for accommodation in MRI
PAS ats - at least temporal stay in Bialowieza during
the project is required.
Candidates will be evaluated by a commission at the
Mammal Research Institute Polish Academy of Sciences
in Bialowieza. After a preliminary assessment of the
submitted documents, the candidates will be invited for
an interview.
Applications should be sent directly to the Project
Leader by letter or electronically by September 20th
2017. The candidates will be invited to an interview
and the decision will be announced by September 21th
2017.

Budapest HostParasiteCoevolution
Young researcher position is oered for 2 years at Plant
Protection Institute, Centre for Agricultural Research,
Budapest, Hungary. Applicants must have MSc degree.
We consider fresh graduates, as well as those at the
nal stage of their PhD or postdocs, as long as they
can devote themselves to this task. Wage according to
standard Hungarian academic wage table. We expect
Hungarian candidates who nished their studies abroad
and wish to return, but any EU citizen could equally
apply. Outside EU we have no experience, but might
investigate possibilities. Within the lab/institute you
get along with English, outside also, but maybe with
some diculties.
Topic: Our group studies a multitrophic model system
that consists of a predator (spider), sap feeding herbivore
that is also a vector of plant disease (leafhopper), plant
disease (a virus) and plant (cereal crop). We are inter-
ested in trait mediated cascading eects and the binary
relationship between the actors, including coevolution
between the parasite (virus) and its host and vector
and the possibility/consequences of host/vector manip-
ulation. We have multiple approaches (behavioural
observations, electrophysiological and chemical ecolog-
ical studies, as well as semi-eld and eld work). In
the topic we also oer the possibility to start PhD at
a Hungarian university (concrete topic, possibilities to
be discussed). See project and publications posted on
Researchgate.
Task: The researcher should conduct molecular work
(PCR) to analyse spider gut contents and follow the
route of virus infection within the system during the ex-
periments, develop own PhD/postdoc topic on parasite-

The evolution of color pattern diversity in the context
of mimicry has been a focus of theoretical and empirical
attention, yet knowledge of the genetic basis of this di-
versity remains limited, especially in vertebrates. This
project involves three research groups with complemen-
tary skills and realms of expertise in an investigation
of the genetic basis and population genomic processes
underlying color pattern divergence in the context of
mimicry in the Peruvian mimic poison frog, *Ranit-
omeya imitator*: Dr. Kyle Summers (East Carolina
University), Dr. Rasmus Nielsen (UC Berkeley) and Dr.
Matthew MacManes (University of New Hampshire).
The project focuses on identifying genetic factors in-
volved in color pattern development and divergence be-
tween populations in *R. imitator. *Several approaches
will be used, including investigations of dierential gene
expression across developmental stages and color pattern
morphs using transcriptomics (RNAseq), and the use of
genome-wide marker arrays (exome capture sequences)
to screen samples collected in the eld and enable admix-
ture mapping. We have identied three admixture zones
in the mimetic radiation that are appropriate for these
analyses. We will also test the association of specic loci
putatively aecting color pattern using pedigree analy-
ses of candidate genes, using multigenerational pedigrees
from frogs raised in captivity. Molecular probes will
be used to investigate the role of candidate genes in
the development of color pattern. Finally, we will test
specic hypotheses regarding selection and demographic
processes in the transition zones and between mimics
and models. Together these complementary, mutuallyreinforcing approaches will begin to reveal the genetic
underpinnings and population genomics of color pattern
diversity in this mimetic radiation of poison frogs.

biology. It is not an aquaculture-oriented project, nor
ecological monitoring. I may take other students for

MemorialU PlantConservation
Ph.D. position in Plant Conservation and Phylogeogra-
phy at Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada
I am seeking a motivated Ph.D. student to conduct a
project with two main objectives. The rst is to char-
acterize a trans-Andean migration route for rainforest
taxa. This project will use palm taxa (Arecaceae) as
case studies to elucidate a pattern of trans-Andean mi-
gration across a region of low elevation in the Andes of
Loja, Ecuador. There are numerous taxa in the palm
family with a disjunct distribution on the pacic side of
Ecuador and Colombia (Choco region) and the eastern
side of the Andes in Peru and Bolivia (Western Amazo-
nia). Diversication times for taxa on either side of this
barrier and a potential directionality of the migration
will be inferred through a phylogeographic approach.
A second goal is to conduct a conservation genetics
study of the palm genus Parajubaea hypothesized to
have colonized the Andes from the Atlantic forest ofBrazil <22 million years ago. This genus contains only
3 species (did not radiate much), two of which are IUCN
threatened with wild populations restricted to Bolivia,
where it is economically important. Its reproductive
biology and specialized habitat could explain its lim-
ited diversication and colonization to the rest of the
Andes. Other research questions of interest to the stu-
dent are welcome within the framework of Neotropical
plant evolution. The Ph.D. student will work under the

PhD position available at Groningen Institute for Evo-
lutionary Life Sciences, University of Groningen, The
Netherlands
Project title:
Environmental predictability and the evolution of
parental eects: integrating ecology, phylogeny, mod-
elling and genetics
Project summary:
To predict how species will adapt in a rapidly changing
world requires evolutionary models based on knowledge
of developmental plasticity to various forms of environ-
mental uctuations. A hotly debated pathway of such
plasticity is based on the transfer of non-genetic informa-
tion from parents to ospring - known as parental eects.
According to recent theoretical models, if parental and
ospring environments are suciently alike, then the
parental phenotype can be used as a source of infor-
mation for ospring to adaptively match their environ-
ment. Thus, parental eects may play a crucial role in
adaptation to changing environments. We will use a
comparative approach to test this prediction in multi-
ple Drosophila species, sampled globally from popula-
tions with dierent levels of similarity in ambient tem-
perature between parental and ospring environments.
We recently demonstrated adaptive parental eects in
Drosophila melanogaster: the eggs of parents who re-
produced at low or high temperatures survived better
to adulthood when parental and ospring thermal con-
ditions matched (both low or both high). Using similar
experiments, we will quantify how parental eects aect
adaptation in the sampled Drosophila populations. To
test the theory, we will develop quantitative evolutionary
models, taking into account observed population-specic
demography and temperature uctuations, and predict
the relative importance of parental eects. Using genes
discovered in our ongoing experimental evolution study
on parental eects in D. melanogaster, we will compare
sequence and structure of candidate genes underlying
parental eects from the sampled populations. By thusintegrating theory, ecology and genetics we will critically
advance our understanding of transgenerational adaptive
plasticity and quantify its importance for adaptation in
a world with increasingly rapid changes in temperature.
Requirements of candidates:
We are looking for a highly motivated candidate with
a relevant M.Sc. who can work in a multidisciplinary
team combining evolutionary studies with mathematical
modelling.

vation + CV) please contact:

Paris-Sud AdaptationDomestication
Title: Origin, spread and demographic history of the
major apple aphid pest in Eurasia.
Summary
Ever since Darwin's time, domestication has been used
as a model for investigating adaptation. Studies of the
mechanisms of adaptation in the context of domestica-
tion are particularly relevant related to crop parasites,
with frequent host shifts involving adaptation to new
hosts following anthropic environmental changes. Our
project aims at understanding the impact of apple do-
mestication on the adaptation of a major apple aphid
pest Dysaphis plantaginea (the rosy apple aphid), to its
apple hosts in Eurasia, the cultivated (Malus domestica)
and wild apples (Malus sylvestris, Malus sieversii and
Malus orientalis).
A crucial rst step in this project is to determine the
worldwide spread routes, the genetic diversity and ge-
netic structure of the Rosy apple aphid using population
genetic approaches. The student will use newly devel-
oped microsatellite markers for the genetic characteriza-
tion of collection of D. plantaginea accessions sampled
from dierent hosts in Eurasia. It will make it possible
to reconstruct the history of D. plantaginea populations
in the context of the domestication of its apple host.
In addition to understanding the adaptation of insect
pests to recent anthropocene changes, this project will
develop technical innovations aimed at biological sus-
tainable agriculture to control parasitic aphids in apple
production.
Methodology : population genetic analyses (genetic di-
versity, population structure and demographic inferences
using Approximate Bayesian Computation).
Prole preferred for the candidate : Ideally, the candi-
date will have skills in genetics/genomics and evolution
and at least will show strong interest in these elds.
He/she will not necessarily be familiar with aphid mod-
els. The Master project will be proposed to the Doctoral
School Science du Vegetal (Paris-Sud Doctoral School)
for a PhD project on the genomic basis of aphid adap-
tation to their host in the context of domestication in
june 2018.

*** PhD position available***
*The genomic basis of host-symbiont dependency*
*Background *
Organisms across the tree of life form partnerships with
microbes for protection, metabolic and nutrition. In
some cases, host and symbiont become so tightly asso-
ciated that dependency evolves and the two organisms
integrate both physically and genomically. Dependency
on microbes is particularly prevalent among insects.
These acquisitions have led many groups of insect to
great success by allowing them to use otherwise unavail-
able resources and invade inaccessible habitats. Here we
explore how dependency on microbes evolves, and how
genomes combine to produce the novel functions that
have allowed insects to dominate so many habitats.
In this project you will use the symbionts of ants and
aphids to rigorously test hypotheses on the evolution of
symbiotic dependency. This may include: exploring the
early stages of genome integration in hosts that have
recently evolved dependency on microbes; revealing the
functional role of symbionts through shared metabolic
pathways with hosts; and determining how host ecology
inuences gains and losses of symbionts.
o You will have access to large genetic databases, insect
collections, in-house live organisms and cutting-edge
research facilitates to fuel your investigation.
o You will gain experience of molecular/experimental bi-
ology, comparative/metagenomics, bioinformatics, and
statistics (e.g. comparative phylogenetics).
o You will be encouraged to develop your own ideas and
hypotheses.
*Skills preferred* In a multidisciplinary project such as
this, candidates are unlikely to have a background in all
disciplines involved. The most important qualication
is motivation and that the project appeals to you. We
can envisage strong candidates coming through various
routes including: - bioinformatics - practical molecular
biology - evolutionary theory

Australia. The rst results from the project revealed
a remarkably deep and abiding population structure
across Australia tracing back to the peopling of the con-
tinent 50kya (Tobler et al. Nature 2017;544:180-184).
The candidates must have, as a minimum, an excellent
undergraduate academic record and meet the English
Language Prociency (ELP) requirement. The call is
open to international and domestic students with back-
grounds in bioinformatics, mathematics, statistics, com-
puter science, population/quantitative genetics, or a
related eld. While a background in biology is desirable,
it is not a prerequisite for success, as training opportu-
nities in genetics, human evolution, molecular biology,
or other related areas can be provided during the PhD.
Successful candidates will be involved in the analyzing
genomic datasets from Indigenous populations across
Australia, New Guinea and Indonesia, with special em-
phasis on adoption and expansion of statistical tools to
reconstruct the genetic history of the original human
migrants into Australia.
Good computational and analytical skills are of high im-portance and a successful candidate would be competent
in one or more of the following: - Statistical analysis of
large datasets and/or mathematical modelling - Fluency
in using Linux systems, with a prior hands-on experi-
ence with Bash scripting - Programming in a scripting
language such as Python and/or R

PhD, MSc and Honours positions available for new
project on the evolutionary origins of song learning
in birds. This project is a collaboration between Dr.
Kristal Cain (kecain.weebly.com) at the University of
Auckland in New Zealand, and Dr. Michelle Hall
(michellehall.wordpress.com) at The University of Mel-
bourne in Australia. Both domestic and international
applications are encouraged.
Vocal learning in birds is of great interdisciplinary im-
portance and an excellent model for human language.
This research relies on a clear understanding of the evo-
lutionary origins of vocal learning, but recent reports
have undermined previous assumptions, leading to a
hotly contested debate about the evolution of vocal
learning. Vocal development in one group of birds, the
New Zealand wrens (Acanthisitti), is critical for resolv-
ing this debate, but is currently unknown and unstudied.
The project will focus on ti Itipounamu/rieman and
combine in-depth behavioural analyses with new acous-
tic tools to determine whether vocalisations are learned
or innate in these endemic birds. We are also interested
in sex dierences in vocal acquisition patterns.
This project is strongly eld-oriented and will require
substantial time in remote areas. There is exibility
for keen students to guide the direction of the researchOctober 1, 2017 EvolDir 29
within the framework of the overall project. The PhD
project is anticipated to start mid-2018, with eldwork
commencing in August. Informal inquiries are welcome.
Preferred selection criteria
- Strong previous academic record
- Enthusiasm and interest in the broad concepts and
questions motivating the research
- Interest in undertaking eld-based avian research, es-
pecially acoustic data
- Enjoyment of outdoor eldwork and condence in work-
ing in remote locations that can experience extreme
weather.
- Excellent interpersonal, oral and written communica-
tion skills
- Ability to learn/use R (statistical programming lan-
guage), new packages for analysis (e.g. warbleR), and
new software (e.g. Sound Analysis Pro)
- Experience with bird banding/ringing, nest searching,
and acoustic techniques is helpful, but not required

1 PhD position for a conservation biologist/restoration
ecologist at the University of Bern, Switzerland.
within our new research programme funded by the Swiss
National Science Foundation:
Restoring grassland biodiversity: from degraded, species-
poor to integral stable-state ecosystems
Farmland of the Swiss Lowlands is devoted to high-
intensity, modern agriculture that has generated precar-
ious conditions for biodiversity, as typically encountered
in most Western and Central Europe. Agri-environment
schemes have tried to remedy to these dramatic situ-
ation, but have had limited success so far. We shall
experimentally - full-block design with random alloca-
tion of treatment to eld - evaluate the eectiveness
of pro-active reseeding methods for restoring ora-rich
hay meadows. The restoration methods tested consist
of 1) simple hay transfer from biodiversity-rich, donor
meadows; 2) sawing locally collected or commercialised
seed mixtures. The overarching objective is to push
degraded plant and invertebrate assemblages towards
species-richer, stable-state grasslands.
The PhD candidate will collect baseline data (before
interventions) and monitor subsequent biotic and abi-
otic environmental changes (following experimental ma-
nipulation) using a series of metrics for biodiversity
(plant and invertebrate species richness, diversity in-
dices, functional traits, community analyses, etc.), as
well as for hay productivity and quality. The reliance
on a full block design will enable avoiding the caveats
and biases typically encountered in mere observational
studies, notably those caused by unavoidable confound-
ing environmental factors such landscape naturalness.
The ultimate objective of this research is to provide
end-users, notably farmers and authorities, with eas-
ily implementable, evidence-based recommendations for
future grassland restoration strategies that maximize
the return on investment of the agricultural subsidies
targeting biodiversity. The experiment will start in 2018
and is foreseen to run 4-8 years, with the PhD candidate
engaged in its rst phase.
The candidate holds a MSc degree, shows a strong in-
terest in agro-ecology and masters modern analytical
techniques and statistical software. Knowledge of grass-30 EvolDir October 1, 2017
land indicator taxa would be advantageous though not
prerequisite. English literacy is important, while knowl-
edge of German and French would represent a real asset,
notably for dealing with farmers. Start: January 2018.
Salary according to SNSF rules. The PhD student will
have to contribute to teaching and some minor adminis-
trative duties.

We are seeking an enthusiastic student for a PhD cen-
tered on the phylogenetic ecology of invertebrates in
food webs. This PhD project will combine phylogeny,
biogeography and community ecology to test mecha-
nisms of food web change across geographic and en-
vironmental gradients. The large geographic scale of
this project is made possible by an existing network
of researchers, the Bromeliad Working Group, which
has already documented aquatic invertebrate food webs
from 2000 bromeliads in 16 sites across Central and
South America. In this project, the PhD student will
use sequencing to construct phylogenies of invertebratesfrom these sites, and then combine the phylogenies with
the existing food web information. This creates a unique
opportunity to reconcile the importance of evolution,
dispersal and environmental ltering on food web struc-
ture.
The successful applicant will have a strong background
in evolution and ecology, excellent grades, and above all
a passion for biology. Ideally, the applicant will have
independent research experience or a MSc. in evolution,
molecular biology or ecology. The applicant should be
competitive for national scholarships, such as NSERC
or NSF, and will be expected to apply for such grants.
The PhD student will spend time at both the Univer-
sity of British Columbia (Vancouver, Canada) and at
Rutgers University (New Jersey, USA). Prof. Diane
Srivastava (UBC) will supervise the food web aspects of
the project, whereas Prof. Jessica Ware (Rutgers) will
supervise the molecular and phylogenetic aspects. The
student will be registered in the PhD program at UBC,
and become part of the Biodiversity Research Centre -
a leading research hub in ecology and evolution.

Ecology, Evolution of selng
The Ecology Group in Department of Biology at the Uni-
versity of Konstanz invites applications for a Doctoral
Research Position (salary scale 65 % of 13 TVL)
We are seeking to ll a 3-year PhD position, part of a
DFG-funded project on reproductive isolation and drift
load in the North American plant species Arabidopsis
lyrata, which was recently granted to Dr.
Marc Stift (https://sites.google.com/site/marcstift/).
Arabidopsis lyrata has become a model for the evolu-
tion of selng. It is normally self-incompatible and thus
obligately outcrossing, but in some North American
populations self-incompatibility has broken down and
led to high selng rates. This oers unique opportu-
nities to study the ecological processes that drive the
evolution of new selng lineages, which forms the core
of the project.
The PhD student will be based at the Ecology lab at
the University of Konstanz (led by Prof. Mark van
Kleunen), but the project involves common-garden ex-
periments in the species ^A native range in Canada. The
student will thus stay in Canada during the eld sea-
sons (collaboration with Prof. Marcel Dorken, Trent
University, Canada).
Applicants should have a keen interest in evolutionary
ecology and hold a Master degree (or equivalent) in the
relevant research elds (e.g.
plant ecology, evolution). Applicants should possess
a driving license, and ideally have relevant experience
with large and complex experiments in the eld and/or
the greenhouse. Knowledge of insects (pollinator iden-
tication in the eld) is a plus. This full-time position
requires strong writing and statistical skills (preferably
in R). The salary will be at 65% of scale 13 TV-L (the
standard PhD-position salary in Germany). The start-
ing date is negotiable, but we intend to ll the position
as soon as possible.
The University of Konstanz is one of the Universities
of Excellence in the Federal Republic of Germany, and
is located on a small campus just outside the beauti-
ful university town of Konstanz at the shore of Lake
Constance. The Ecology group is young and very inter-national, and works on a diverse set of topics, including
life-history evolution, plant responses to global change
and determinants of plant invasiveness.
The University of Konstanz encourages applications
from people with a disability. They will be given prefer-
ence if appropriately qualied (contact +49 7531 / 88 -
4016). The University of Konstanz is an equal opportu-
nity employer that tries to increase the number of women
in research and teaching, and is committed to further

collaborative research and training network created to
advance evolutionary and ecological genomics in natu-
ral populations. The UNVEIL network (Using Natural
Variation to Educate, Innovate, and Lead) is funded
by a recent NSF EPSCoR award, and brings together
researchers from the University of Montana and the
University of Nebraska. The network seeks to advance
our understanding of the genetic basis of tness-related
traits in wild populations and to train the next genera-
tion of integrative biologists to solve pressing societal
challenges in ecological and conservation genomics.
https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/-
showAward?AWD ID=3D3D1736249 The research
and training activities of the UNVEIL network will
center around three core projects, which are united by
their conceptual focus on adaptation to spatiotemporal
environmental variation - high altitude adaptation
and hypoxia resistance in deer mice, adaptation to
climate change in snowshoe hares and other species
that undergo seasonal phenotypic changes, and thermal
adaptation in yellow monkeyowers. Network members
and trainees will work collaboratively on these projects
to meet the following goals:
1. Advance the science of genome-to-phenome connec-
tions through the development of novel approaches for
the integration of functional and genomic data.
2. Develop ethical guidelines for the application of ge-
nomic interventions for wildlife conservation.
3. Create a unique interdisciplinary training environ-
ment to broaden participation in the STEM workforce,
and to train integrative biologists that are both tech-
nically and ethically equipped to leverage genomic ap-
proaches to solve ecological and conservation challenges.
In the coming years, the network will provide a variety of
opportunities that may be of interest to the community:
Postdoctoral Fellowships: Over the next four years, we
will fund four postdoctoral fellowships within the net-work. We anticipate lling two of these positions this
year. In addition to a competitive salary and bene-
ts package, fellows will be provided generous research
funds ( $50,000; $25,000/year over two years) to allow
them the freedom to creatively extend the core projects
in novel directions or to work on complementary ques-
tions in independent experimental systems with active
mentorship from one or more members of the UNVEIL
network.
Graduate Student Research Assistantships: We will
also fund graduate student research assistantships on
both campuses. Two UNVEIL Diversity Fellowships
will be available in the Fall of 2018 and will support one
graduate fellow on each campus for a three-year tenure.
Additional research assistantships will be available for
students to work on aspects of the core projects outlined
above.
Annual symposia: Finally, to aid in the exchange of
ideas and to advance research and training activities
both within and beyond the network, we will hold yearly
UNVEIL conferences. These conferences will feature
1.) a scientic program focused on evolutionary and
ecological genomics in wild populations, 2.) technical
and analytical workshops, and 3.) working group ses-
sions to develop ethical frameworks for the application
of genomic interventions for wildlife conservation. We
anticipate broad participation from biologists, philoso-
phers, and land managers in the ethics working groups
and these sessions will serve as catalysis meetings to
formulate policy position white papers, synthesis papers
for academic audiences, and ethics training materials.
Specic announcements of all of these activities will be
disseminated periodically as deadlines approach, but
interested postdoctoral and graduate fellowship candi-
dates are strongly encouraged to contact one or more of
the following UNVEIL PIs to discuss these opportunities

UValencia ViralEvolution
A PhD contract is available at the laboratory of Rafael
Sanju an (University of Valencia, Spain).
Starting date: end 2017.
Place: recently created Institute for Integrative Systems
Biology (I2SysBio), Valencia, Spain.
Project title: Collective Infectious Units and the Social
Evolution of Viruses.
Funding: ERC Consolidator Grant, 2017-2022.
Goal: understand how multi-virion infectious units de-
termine social-like interactions in viruses (cooperation
versus conict). We will baculoviruses as model systems.
Candidates should have a background in molecular/cell
biology and virology (preferably with baculoviruses).
ERC project summary:
A widely accepted view in virology is that virions func-
tion as independent infectious units. However, recent
work by us and others indicates that viruses are often
transmitted as more complex structures, such as virion
aggregates, lipid vesicles or protein matrices harbour-
ing multiple infectious particles. This demonstrates
that viruses can be transmitted as \collective infectious
units", in contrast with the current paradigm. Criti-
cally, these recent discoveries now set the stage for the
evolution of social interactions, a previously unappre-
ciated facet of viruses. We propose to investigate how
collective infectious units drive virus social evolution
using state-of-the-art tools from the elds of virology,
genetics, structural biology, and nanotechnology. The
eects of collective infectivity on viral tness will be
tested directly using experimental evolution and genetic
engineering, and conrmed in vivo. Three widely dier-
ent viruses will be used to achieve generality: human
enteroviruses, a vector-borne rhabdovirus, and a bac-
ulovirus. Furthermore, the implications of virus social
interactions for the maintenance of genetic diversity,
evolvability, virulence evolution, and the emergence of
drug resistance will be investigated. New processes such
as the putative extracellular fusion of viral particles will
be also explored. We expect that infectious units consti-
tuted by viruses from dierent species will be uncovered
as well, with far-reaching implications for epidemiology.
It is becoming increasingly recognized that parasite so-
ciality is a disease determinant, and our results maytherefore inspire new antiviral strategies. Beyond their
practical importance viruses will also provide a simple
and tractable system that will help us to establish more
general principles of social evolution.

PhD student in Plant Evolutionary Biology (m/f)
Whole genome doubling and hybridization profoundly
shaped plant genome evolution. However, to be success-
ful, rst generations allopolyploids must quickly adjust
their genome and function, thereby altering their eco-
logical properties and adaptive success, as a function
of their environment. The duplicated nature of poly-
ploids buers more eectively deleterious alleles and
provides genome-wide opportunities for adaptive evo-
lution. Recurrent origins of polyploids are widespread
and provide natural replicates to study the links be-
tween whole genome doubling and rapid adaptation to
divergent environments.
A 3-years PhD position funded by the Austrian Sci-
ence Fund (FWF) is immediately available in our group,
focusing of a fairly young polyploid group in Dacty-
lorhiza, comprising sibling European orchids with diver-
gent ecological preferences. Specically, to complement
ongoing analyses of the nature of the extant molecu-
lar diversity in the Dactylorhiza allopolyploids, we will
interrogate the adaptive value of this diversity within re-
ciprocal transplant experiments in the Alps and Scandi-
navia. We will shed light on the links between genotype,
epigenotype and environmental conditions, by focusing
on the environmental sensitivity of gene expression (with
RNAseq) and of post-transcriptional regulation by small
RNAs (with smRNAseq), exploring also in detail the
link between DNA methylation patterns, TE activity
and expression of duplicated genes.

UWollongong EvolutionFishSociality
We are seeking a highly motivated PhD student to join
an on-going research project on the evolution of so-
ciality in coral reef shes, based at the University of
Wollongong, NSW, Australia.42 EvolDir October 1, 2017
Overview: This is an exciting opportunity to join an
interdisciplinary team of researchers to understand the
causes and consequences of sociality in reef shes. The
project will combine eld experimental investigations
at multiple sites along the Great Barrier Reef with
laboratory genetic analysis based at the University of
Wollongong. Research funding for this project is se-
cured, and we currently seek a motivated and talented
student to undertake this project.
The project supervisors are: University of Wollongong:
Dr. Marian Wong and Prof. Mark Dowton University

Outline: Sociality is a common and taxonomically
widespread phenomenon in tropical marine shes. In
spite of this, comparative analyses of sociality to date
have been focused on birds, mammals and insects.
Coral-reef shes are an ideal group with which to
test the generality of hypotheses for social evolution
because: i) they exhibit considerable inter-specic
variation in social organization, ii) species-level
phylogenetic relationships have already been resolved
for some key groups of coral-reef shes, and iii) they
inhabit shallow coral reefs facilitating eld observa-
tions, experiments and collections (for summary see:
https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/63/6/-
453/226119/Social-Systems-in-Habitat-Specialist-Reef).
As the ecology and life-history of sh dier in major re-
spects to birds, mammals and insects, this comparative
analysis of sociality will likely yield novel and transfor-
mative results that will signicantly advance the eld
of social evolution (see: DOI: 10.3389/fevo.2017.00100).
This PhD project will investigate the causes and
consequences of sociality in one particular group of
coral-reef shes known as \habitat-specialists". These
species reside permanently within discrete patches of
reef habitat, including corals and anemones.

*PhD Position in Evolutionary Ecology*
**
*On: Demographic and evolutionary modelling of local
adaptation to the tidal environment in /Clunio mari-
nus/*
**
*at the University of Zurich, Switzerland*
**
A PhD position in evolutionary ecology, of 48 months du-
ration, is available at the University of Zurich working
with Prof Hanna Kokko and her international team
www.kokkonuts.org . /Clunio marinus/is a marine
midge that has a unique life history, living in the in-
tertidal zone of the European Atlantic coast. Local
adaptation is important, as the timing of low tides dif-
fers across coastal locations. Populations indeed dier
in their lunar and diurnal rhythms of adult emergence,
and the dierences are genetic (as known from past
crossing experiments and through genomic work by Dr.
Tobias Kaiser).
This project, which forms a collaboration between Dr.
Kaiser's group at the Max Planck Institute for Evolu-
tionary Biology in Pl on and Prof. Kokko's group at the
University of Zurich, aims to ll in a knowledge gap
considering the evolutionary demography of the species:
how is local adaptation maintained, given the dierentdispersal options leading to dierent genotypes mating,
potentially producing maladapted emergence times with
respect to seasonal phenology and/or lunar cycles?
The ideal candidate has a grasp of demographic and/or
evolutionary modelling, and a willingness to develop
his/her skills further in this regard. The PhD will be
awarded by the University of Zurich, which is also the
main location of the student's work, but the project also
involves visits to Pl on and the potentially many coastal
eld sites.
The working language in the group is English (German
skills are not essential). The position is available as
soon as the candidate has been found. The evaluation
of applications begins on October 10, 2017, and will
continue until a suitable candidate has been found.
Applicants should send a cover letter with a
-Statement of their research interests
-C.V., and
-The names and contact details of at least one referee.
Applications should form a single pdf le and this should
be sent to: hanna.kokko@ieu.uzh.ch

PhD position
Comparative genomics of placenta development in live-
bearing sh
Job description
One of the fundamental questions in biology is: \how
do complex traits evolve?" Our ability to discern how
complex traits evolved is limited because their origin
occurred in the distant past and details of their evolu-
tion have been lost due to the extinction of species with
intermediate stages of complexity. In this project you
aim to unravel the molecular pathways that underlie the
evolution of the placenta in the livebearing sh family
Poeciliidae (which includes the guppy). This family
evolved placentas multiple times independently and con-
tains closely-related species as well as populations within
species that vary markedly in placental complexity. The
presence of this variation in placental complexity at such
shallow taxonomic levels is truly unparalleled in nature
and oers a unique opportunity to study the evolution
of complexity. In the project you will apply a compara-
tive genomics approach, studying multiple independentOctober 1, 2017 EvolDir 45
evolutionary origins of the placenta aiming to uncover
the commonalities in genome architecture that underlie
its evolution. The project will involve whole genome se-
quencing of selected species across the phylogeny, as well
as the de-novo assembly and annotation of the genomes
of a number of key species to ll in taxonomic gaps.
You will aim to infer the evolution of genes and the
modication of developmental and metabolic pathways
during the evolution of the placenta. The project is for
a period of 4 years.
Requirements
For this interdisciplinary project, we look for an en-
thusiastic, result-driven person with an MSc degree in
biology, bioinformatics, or related eld. The candidate
should have anity with evolutionary biology. Anity
with computational biology or bioinformatics is required,
prociency in a programming language (e.g. Python,
R), and experience in working with Linux are highly val-
ued. Excellent research skills are required and excellent
communication skills and prociency in English (both
oral and written) are prerequisite.
Conditions of employment
The PhD student will work at the Experimental Zool-
ogy (EZO) and Animal Breeding and Genomics (ABG)
groups of Wageningen University (the Netherlands).
The PhD student will be supervised by Dr. Pollux, an
expert on placenta evolution in livebearing sh, and
Dr. Megens, who is an expert on evolutionary genomics
and bioinformatics. The PhD project is part of a largerresearch programme at Wageningen University led by
Dr. Pollux that focuses on the causes, mechanisms
and consequences of placenta evolution using cutting-
edge interdisciplinary research, including eld-based
research, biomechanics, life history evolution, quantita-
tive genetics, functional genomics and bioinformatics.
Employment basis: temporary for a 4 year period, max-
imum hours per week: 38. Continuation of the appoint-
ment will be based on a performance evaluation after
18 months. Gross salary will increase from euro 2222,-
in the rst year up to euro 2840,- per month in the last
year based on a full-time appointment (38 hours per
week).
Additional information
Applications should include a letter of motivation, CV
and names of three references. You can apply for this
position until September 25, 2017.

Curator, Ornithology
The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County
(NHM) seeks a Curator to lead its research on birds,
oversee the growth and care of the ornithology collection,
and to provide content for a variety of public programs.
These activities will support NHM's new strategic goals
of understanding and promoting urban biodiversity and
strengthening and activating its research and collections
departments.
NHM, the largest natural history museum in the western
United States, holds one of the world's best collections
of extant birds. This includes over 120,000 specimens-
primarily study skins and skeletons-representing more
than 5,200 species. The collection is strongest for theAmericas and Africa, and it is also important for the
Pacic region. NHM also holds extensive collections
of fossil birds, including the renowned collection of the
La Brea Tar Pits. These, together with other impor-
tant ornithological collections in Southern California
(e.g., the Moore Laboratory of Zoology, UCLA-Dickey
Bird and Mammal Collection, and Western Foundation
of Vertebrate Zoology), make Los Angeles an unparal-
leled place for collections-based, ornithological research.
Moreover, the region is home to over 500 extant bird
species and comprises a diversity of habitats that oer
many potential sites for eld research.
The successful candidate will have a record of out-
standing research, excellent communication skills, and
a demonstrated ability to engage the public and stake-
holders. A Ph.D. and a strong track record of peer-
reviewed publications that focus on evolutionary biology
and/or ecology (e.g., taxonomy, systematics, biogeogra-
phy, global change, urban nature, and/or biodiversity
science) are required. He/she will be expected to build
an active and publically appealing research program,
to oversee all NHM's programs on living birds, and to
supervise the sta and volunteers of the Department
of Ornithology. Additionally, the successful candidate
is expected to develop working relationships with local
universities, mentor students and postdoctoral fellows,
strengthen NHM's presence in key professional and gov-
ernmental networks, and maintain research through
competitive grants and/or other funding from external
sources. The successful candidate will also be expected
to participate actively in a broad range of museum ac-
tivities, including exhibits, education, citizen science
programs, training of educators and volunteers, public
communications and media interactions, and fundraising
activities. A vision and capability to build a research
program that can be integrated within the NHM's ongo-
ing eorts to understand urban biodiversity-particularly
in Southern California-and to shape the collections and
research in ways that activate both its scientic and
public appeal is paramount.
NHM is seeking applicants who have demonstrated expe-
rience and commitment working with a diverse commu-
nity. This is a full-time position with a salary and title
commensurate with experience, plus excellent benets.
Application deadline is November 15th, 2017. The start-
ing date is July 1st, 2018. Applicants should send
a cover letter and vision statement, curriculum vitae,

genetics and evolutionary forces (mutation, selection)
shapes the capacity of populations to show rapid adap-
tive responses. The results will be relevant in a variety
of applied contexts, including climate change, antibiotic
treatments or agricultural pest control. Practically, the
project will use high-throughput phenotyping, genomics
and quantitative genetics in the ssion yeast Schizosac-
charomyces pombe and day-to day activities will involve
techniques from micro- and molecular biology.
The research technician will work as part of a dedicated
team and interact with both the groups of Max Reuter,
working on evolutionary constraints on phenotypic adap-
tation (http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/ ~ucbtmre/-
Labsite), and J urg B ahler, working on genome regula-
tion (http://www.bahlerlab.info/home/). The post will
be based in UCL's Research Department of Genetics,
Evolution and Environment, which oers a stimulating
and interactive environment across the elds of evo-
lutionary and human genetics to biodiversity research.
Further aeld, UCL oers a great diversity of world-class
research right in the centre of London.
The position is an opportunity for a highly motivated
and ambitious individual who enjoys working in a team.
The candidate will have (or be about to obtain) an
undergraduate degree in a relevant discipline, proven re-
search skills and relevant experience (molecular and/ormicrobiology, high-throughput techniques) and excellent
verbal and written communication skills.
The post is available from 1st November 2017 (nego-
tiable) for up to 30 months, with a starting salary be-
tween 23,604 (20,624 plus 2,980 London Allowance) and

Research Assistant position
The Department of Biological Sciences at the University
of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) is currently accepting
application submissions for a research intern position
in Dr. Filipe Alberto's laboratory, studying genetic im-
provement for aquaculture of the giant kelp Macrocystis
pyrifera.
A research intern position to conduct the development
of a germplasm collection of haploid strains of kelp
(brown algae) is available in the Alberto lab at UW-
Milwaukee, US. The collection will be the basis for a
genetic improvement program aimed at faster growth
and temperature and low nutrient tolerance in aquacul-
ture. The project will require setting a large number of
individual gametophyte cultures, medium preparation,
environmental chamber work, excellent organizational
skills and capacity to work under strict deadlines. Indi-
vidual haploid cultures will have their biomass bulked
up to provide sucient biomass to extract DNA in quan-
tity and quality required for genomic analysis and allow
strain crossing. A post-doctoral researcher will work
closely with the research intern and the PI to achieve
the project goals. Experience in population genomics
lab techniques is a plus. Microsatellite marker analysis
will also be used to monitor strain identity and culture
purity at dierent stages of growth. The germplasm col-lection will be at the basis of a Marker Assisted Selection
program developed with partner institutions (UC Santa
Barbara, U Southern California and JCVI) involving
genome sequencing and annotation, phenotype typing of
outplanted sporophytes in Southern California, capture
sequencing of genetic variants (SNP) and the estimation
of a predictive model linking genotype and phenotype
for traits of interest.
Applicants are required to have a Bachelor of Sciences
in Biological Sciences, or equivalent degree. Research
experience in breeding experiments, seaweed biology
and seaweed cultivation are preferred. Familiarity with
population genetics software is a plus. Computer skills
in data analysis and biostatistics are also important
merits.
Other broad research interests in the Alberto lab are pop-
ulation genetics and evolutionary ecology of seaweeds
and marine plants. Our focus is both on empirical re-
search through the acquisition of population genetics
data, using molecular marker techniques, and simulation
based hypothesis testing.
Informal inquiries about the project are encouraged.
Please apply by sending a single pdf document including
1) CV, 2) a declaration of research interests, 3) previous
experience and t for the position and 4) the email
address and telephone number of potential contacts for
reference letters.
Applications should be emailed to Dr. Filipe
Alberto, alberto <mailto:albertof@uwm.edu >f(at)
<mailto:albertof@uwm.edu >uwm.edu
<mailto:albertof@uwm.edu >. Initial contract will be
for one year with possible extension to three years.

B10K unpublished bird genomes
Dear Evoldir,
The B10K consortium has generated an assembled and
annotated avian genome dataset of over 300 species,
principally using Illumina technology. These represent
at least one individual of almost all avian families. Our
principal intended use of the genomes will be to under-
take two major studies - (1) a pan-avian phylogenomic
analysis and (2) a pan-avian comparative genome anal-
ysis, similar to papers we published previously on a
smaller ordinal-level dataset (Zhang et al, Science, 2014;
Jarvis et al, Science 2014). We intend to commence
these analyses in November 2017.
The purpose of this email is to enquire whether any
members of the evoldir community have other unpub-
lished avian de novo sequenced genomes that they may
wish to contribute to the project (by October 31st 2017),
and in doing so join the consortium and its papers. In
this regard, if the data is of suitable quality we would be
very happy to assemble (or re-assemble) and (re-) anno-
tate them with our pipelines to render them consistent
with our dataset.
Should this be of potential interest please do not hesitate
to contact Josen Stiller: josenstiller@gmail.com
Many thanks,
Guojie Zhang, Tom Gilbert & Erich Jarvis on behalf of
the B10K Consortium
Josen Stiller <josenstiller@gmail.com >Bird Colour Base
Dear EvolDir, @BirdColourBase is a database of bird
plumage colour measured with spectrophotometry. Our
database is predominantly comprised of samples col-
lected from museum based collections and all of the data
is standardised by Prof. John Endler. @BirdColourBase
covers >2500 avian species across more than 50% of
all avian families (e.g. Muir PNAS 2005; Dale et al.
Nature 2015; Dunn et al. Sci. Adv. 2015). We would
like to cover all avian families.
Initially, these data will be used for macroevolution-
ary questions about the shape and evolution of avian
colour space. These projects will begin when all families
are represented in the database. If any members of
the EvolDir community have unpublished data on bird
plumage colouration collected with spectrophotometry
we encourage them to get in touch with a view to joining
our group/projects/publications if they can provide new
data.

plications**
Godfrey Hewitt (1940-2013) was President of the Eu-
ropean Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB) from
1999-2001. He was exceptionally inuential in evolu-
tionary biology both through his research and through
his mentoring of young scientists. He was also a great
believer in seeing organisms in their environment rst-
hand and in exchanges of ideas between labs. Therefore,
ESEB has decided to oer, annually, mobility grants for
young scientists in his name.
Closing date: Monday 15 January 2018, 12.00 GMT.
*Eligibility: *
The award is open to PhD students or postdoctoral
scientists who are, at the closing date for applications,
both within 6 years of the start date of their PhD and
ESEB members. In addition, applicants will be consid-
ered who are more than 6 years from the start of their
PhD if they have had career breaks, worked part-time,
or for other reasons have not worked continuously. The
maximum single award will be 2000 Euros. It must be
used to support eldwork or a period of research at a
lab that you have not previously visited. There is no
restriction on the country of residence or nationality of
the applicant. A report will be required by 30 April
2019, by which time the funds must have been used.
*Application procedure: *
Your application should be sent as a single PDF le to
Ute Friedrich at the ESEB oce, oce@eseb.org. It
should include your name, current status and institution,
your PhD start date, your ESEB membership number,
a description of the work to be carried out (maximum
500 words), an outline budget with brief justication
(maximum 100 words) and a signed statement from your
PhD supervisor or postdoctoral adviser (maximum 100
words) explaining why the work cannot be funded from
your home institution or your proposed host institution.
Applications will be considered by a committee chaired
by Roger Butlin. The aim will be to announce deci-
sions before the end of March 2018. In previous rounds,
success rates have been between 20 and 40%.
The committee will consider the following key criteria:
1.The value of the proposed mobility in terms of itsexpected output and impact on the applicant's career.
The committee prefers projects that are: a. Not a core
component of the applicant's existing PhD or postdoc-
toral project, but a new venture. b. Clearly based on
the applicant's own initiative c. Likely to be completed
and have denable output within the award period d.
Have the potential to lead to larger future projects or to
enhance the applicant's career in evolutionary biology
2. The need for the GHM award, i.e. the potential for
the funding provided by ESEB to make a dierence, in
relation to resources already available through the home
or host institution.
Please endeavour to address these points in your appli-
cation.

Conservation Management Survey
The Conservation Genetics Working Group within the
Society for Conservation Biology is working to bring
conservation managers and academic researchers closer
together to help create and implement genetic assess-
ments that can inform conservation management. To do
this we need to know more about the current use of ge-
netic assessments in conservation management and how
geneticists can collaborate with managers to achieve
their conservation goals.
If you are a conservation/resource manager we
would appreciate you taking the time to complete the
conservation manager survey (https://docs.google.com/-
forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfv9auU2Op87u2gqXbp-
4yA37666FXcABGhU8pV56SihjgUA/viewform?usp=-
sflink). Also please share the survey link with any
conservation managers you know, we aim to distribute
this as widely as possible.
If you have any questions please contact me, Dr. Heather
Taft, at Heather.R.Taft@gmail.com.
Thank you for helping us out!

ESEB ProgressMeetings
****Progress meetings in evolutionary biology****October 1, 2017 EvolDir 91
We are excited to announce a new initiative by the
European Society of Evolutionary Biology (ESEB), in
partnership with the Journal of Evolutionary Biology
(JEB).
We invite applications for funding to support focussed
conference or workshops on a topical issue where rapid
progress is currently being made in understanding Evo-
lutionary Biology. ESEB will supply funds up to euro
15,000 to assist with workshop planning (venue, travel
or attendance support). We encourage proposals on any
topic.
We expect these meetings to bring together a range of
researchers focussed around a topic for a \state of the
art" conference, ideally proposing a new synthesis, view-
point or technical or analytical breakthrough facilitating
new avenues of research. Attendees would represent re-
searchers from all career stages and must accord with
our Equal Opportunities guidelines. Attendance should
be open to all, but ESEB members should be prioritised.
Typically, meetings would last 2-3 days.
A condition of the funding is that the meeting has a
clear objective to produce either a Special Issue or Tar-
get Review for JEB. Within 4 months of the meeting
manuscripts arising from the meeting should be submit-
ted to the journal, to be handled by the organisers as
guest editors or the editorial board of JEB, as appropri-
ate.
This is a new opportunity for a one-o topical meeting
for ESEB members and the evolutionary community.
There will be one round per year, with a deadline of *Dec
12h 2017*. Applicants should be members of ESEB or
our sister society, the Society for the Study of Evolution.
There is no ocial application form. The application
document should include
- The title of the conference and why this is suitable for
a Progress Meeting.
-Names and addresses of the organisers, with short (1
page each) CVs
- List of keynote speakers, with justication (potentially
key recent references). They should have agreed in
principle to participate
- A 2-page description of the aims and potential scope
of the conference
- Conference venue details
- Methods of selecting participants
- Publication plans
Applications should be submitted to oce@eseb.org
<mailto:oce@eseb.org >by the deadline. The success-ful application will be chosen by an ESEB committee.

ChilianBirds
PhD research project of the department of Behavioural
Ecology at GELIFES (Groningen Institute for Evolu-
tionary Life Science) Field work close to Santiago de
Chile, in collaboration with Universidad de Chile
I am looking for a eld assistent with experience bird
catching and handling. Due to an accident, I can not
perform these activities by myself and need help on very
short notice. In september, I will study the incubation
behaviour of the small passerine thorn-tailed rayadito,
Aphrastura spinicauda. This bird breeds in nest boxes
which makes it convenient to study.
The eld assistent would catch the birds with mist nets
during the nest building stage (cautious to prevent aban-
doning), ring them with PIT tags, to follow the incuba-
tion behaviour later on. Another responsibility would
be the measuring and bleeding of the nestlings (mass,
wing length, skull length, etc.).
Travel and housing will be paid for. Successful candi-
dates should have experience in the above mentioned
tasks and should be independent workers. As daily
working hours can be long, the candidate should be
highly motivated and have a hard-working mentality.
Free hours and days depend fully on the bird behaviour
and will be scheduled spontanously.
The candidate would work closely together with me,
a newly started PhD researcher. I am a hard worker
myself, however temporarily limited by my injury. I like
to have a good atmosphere while working and having a
good laugh. The working language in Chile is Spanish.
Spanish skills would be a plus but no obligation.
Interested? Contact me through mlmbirker@gmail.com,
so we can set a Skype meeting for further information.

PCI Evol Biol submissions
Dear colleagues
We invite you to submit your future preprints (= articles
not yet published and not under consideration for pub-
lication) to Peer Community in Evolutionary Biology
(PCI Evol Biol, https://evolbiol.peercommunityin.org)
in order to obtain a recommendation from this commu-
nity after peer-reviewing.
PCI Evol Biol is a group of scientists who review and
recommend preprints in evolutionary biology, free of
charge and transparently. It is a research commu-
nity working for researchers to create a new publi-
cation system that is completely free of charge and
independent of private publishers. This community
already includes 330 researchers (the full list can be
found at https://evolbiol.peercommunityin.org/public/-
recommenders) motivated to review and recommend
preprints.
To understand what Peer Community in (PCI, https:/-
/peercommunityin.org) is, you can watch this video
https://youtu.be/4PZhpnc8wwo and to understand the
value of submitting your preprints to these communities,
you can watch it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-
3DjMhVl gupg . Some important points:
- PCI Evol Biol is supported by the American Evolu-
tionary Society (the SSE), the Spanish EvolutionarySociety (the SESBE) and the French Ecological Soci-
ety (the SFE); - PCI Evol Biol does not publish the
preprints (they stay on the preprint server) but the
associated reviews and recommendations; - PCI Evol
Biol does not evaluate preprints already submitted for
publication in a journal, in order to avoid parallel re-
viewings; - Although it is not our goal, authors can
submit their preprints to traditional journals once they
have been recommended by PCI Evol Biol. Reviews ob-
tained before the recommendation can help improve the
quality of the preprint; - Journals such as Ecology Let-
ters, Evolutionary Applications, Evolutionary Ecology,
Evolutionary Biology, Journal of Evolutionary Biology,
BMC Evolutionary Biology, Oikos, Genetica, Journal
of Biogeography and Molecular Ecology indicated that
they will consider the preprints recommended by PCI
Evol Biol and that they will take into account the re-
views and recommendations of PCI Evol Biol in their
own editorial process if adequate. - PCI Evol Biol is
free for all users (readers AND authors); - PCI Evol
Biol's recommendations are transparent (reviews and
recommendations are published, recommendations are
signed, reviewers can remain anonymous if they wish);
- Only reviews leading to a recommendation are pub-
lished; - A preprint recommended by PCI Evol Biol is
scientically validated and can therefore be cited (eg.
Brisson 2017, recommended by Bravo 2017); - PCI Evol
Biol's recommendations have a DOI, are referenced and
can therefore also be cited; - Three new communities
(PCI Ecology, PCI Computational Statistics and PCI
Paleontology) are expected to be launched at the end
of the year/early next year.
To submit your preprints, simply go to https://-
evolbiol.peercommunityin.org and follow the instruc-
tions ('Request a recommendation for your preprint').
We hope to have aroused your interest,

Phylogenomics PhD lab suggestions
Evoldir community,
One of my M.S. students is applying to PhD labs this
fall (starting fall 2018) and he's looking for lab rec-
ommendations. He's interested broadly in evolution-
ary genomics, which could range from populations to
higher-level phylogenetics. His background is in plants
(amjbot.org/content/104/8/1254.short), but he's open
to any organism. He has eld, lab, and coding (mainly
python) skills.
Please let me know of any labs that are potential ts-
we're really casting the net wide. Also feel free to for-
ward this to relevant colleagues.
Thanks!! James

Researcher Database
The communications team at the Society for the Study
of Evolution has a new initiative to improve science com-
munication. We are creating a database of researchers
who would be willing to be contacted by the media to
comment on others' research in their area of expertise.
With increasing specialization of research, it can be
dicult for science communicators to nd appropriate
sources to comment on new research. By joining this
database, you can be a resource for science communica-

EvolutionSmallMammals
Volunteers needed for the period Oct /Nov 2017 to April
2017
Evolution and Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the
Succulent Karoo of South Africa
Opportunity: This is a great opportunity for anybody
who wants to get more experience in eld work related to
animal behavior, evolution, eco-physiology, and ecology
before starting an MSc or PhD project.
Project: We study the evolutionary and ecological rea-
sons as well as physiological mechanisms of group living,
paternal care, communal nesting and social exibility
in the striped mouse. One focus is on the adaptation to
droughts, combining physiological, behavioral, ecologi-
cal and evolutionary research. As this species is diurnal
and the habitat is open, direct behavioral observations
in the eld are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Applicants must have
an interest in working in the eld and with animals.
Hard working conditions will await applicants, as the
study species gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6
AM), and stops its activity with dusk (7 PM). Work
during nights might also be necessary. Work in the
eld will be done for 5 days a week. Applicants must
be able to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at
night in winter, sometimes over 40 ^AoC during summer
days). Applicants must both be prepared to live for
long periods in the loneliness of the eld and to be part
of a small social group.
Work of volunteer eld assistants: Trapping, marking
and radio-tracking of striped mice; direct behavioral ob-
servations in the eld. Volunteers will also see how blood
samples are collected for physiological measurements.
Volunteers are expected to help with maintenance of
the research station (water pump, solar power, etc.).
Conrmation letter: Students get a letter of conrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their univer-
sity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
eld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
1600 (around 110 Euro) must be paid for accommoda-
tion at the research station. Students must buy theirOctober 1, 2017 EvolDir 95
own food etc in Springbok. Including extras (going out
for dinner; shopping), you should expect costs of about
450 Euros or 600 US $per month. Students get an invi-
tation letter which they can use to apply for funding in
their home country.
Place: The eld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: We are looking for volunteers to
start in Oct / Nov 2017 as well as beginning of 2018.
Volunteers are expected to stay for a minimum of 2-3
months, though longer periods are preferred.
How to apply? Send a short motivation let-
ter stating why and for which period you are
interested and your CV via email to succu-
lent.karooo.research.station@kabelbw.de.

Budapest 2 EvolutionaryGenomics
Budapest.2.EvolutionaryGenomics
Final call. Postdocs in evolutionary genomics
and phylogenomics are available to join the ERC
'GENECLOCKS' project (http://cordis.europa.eu/-
project/rcn/207593 en.html) headed by Gergely Szollosi
(http://ssolo.web.elte.hu) . Two positions are oered
for 2 years with the possibility of extension up until
the 2022 end date of the GENECLOCKS project. The
position comes with a salary of up to EUR 43,200 per
year (approx. up to EUR 2,400-2,900 net per month
after taxes), as well as a travel and research funds.
We are looking for an individual who received his or
her PhD preferably within the last six years, who is
highly self-motivated and can work independently on a
project that he or she will help develop in the context
of GENECLOCKS.
A central theme of GENECLOCKS is disclosing new
sources of information for dating the rst three-quarters
of Earth's evolutionary history that are independent
from both fossils and molecular clocks. Life's early his-
tory has remained terra incognita until now, because
the fossils needed to calibrate standard evolutionary
timescales are simply not available for microbial life.
Microbial fossils are scarce and dicult to interpret in aphylogenetic context with condence. In previous work
we have shown that patterns of lateral gene transfer
inferred from modern genomes encode a record of co-
existing lineages throughout the history of life, and that
we can use this record to reconstruct the relative ages
of microbial groups from the three domains of life in
deep time.
This discovery is a game changer for anyone interested
in the history of life, from either a geological or genomic
perspective. It demonstrates the existence of a new
and abundant source of dating information that is in-
scribed in the genome of any organism, provided a gene
transfer occurred in its ancestry. This constitutes the
overwhelming majority of the diversity of life.
Postdocs will undertake projects together with interna-
tional collaborators with the goal of either i) developing
new methods that systematically extract information on
the pattern and timing of genomic evolution by explain-
ing dierences between gene trees, or ii) apply existing
methods to resolve the timing of microbial evolution and
its relationship to Earth history and answer long stand-
ing questions. Possible collaborations and associated
projects include:
Reconstructing a dated phylogeny of Bacteria in collab-
oration with Vincent Daubin at the LBBE in Lyon.
Developing and implementing bayesian methods for the
species tree aware reconstruction of gene trees with
Nicolas Lartillot at the LBBE in Lyon.
Reconstructing a dated phylogeny of Eukaryotes includ-
ing their position within Archaea in collaboration with
Tom Williams at the University of Bristol.
Developing and implementing new methods for species
tree reconstruction in the context of hierarchical gene
tree-species tree methods with Jens Lagergren at the
Science for Life Laboratory in Stockholm.
Implementing and applying methods to include trans-
fer derived relative age constraints in molecular clock
estimates with Bastien Boussau at the LBBE in Lyon.
Developing novel gene tree-species tree reconciliation
methods that model correlated gene histories with Eric
Tannier at LBBE in Lyon.
Research visits of up to several months are foreseen as
part of potential collaborations.
To be considered, please send a single merged PDF to
ssolo@elte.hu that contains your CV including publica-
tion list, preferably with a link to your google scholar
prole, academic transcripts, a statement of research
interests (3 pages or less) as well as three academic
references. Please include 'GENECLOCKS17' in the
subject of your email. Applications will be considered100 EvolDir October 1, 2017

AvianTimingOfReproduction
Two-year postdoctoral position in Evolutionary Ecology
and Physiology of reproduction
Do birds time their reproduction based on the spring
development of vegetation?
Context
The consequences of global warming can only be reliably
estimated if we know how organisms respond to envi-
ronmental changes. One way changes in climate and en-
vironment inuence population resilience is through the
modication of the seasonal timing of life-cycle events
(i.e. phenology). However, species at dierent trophic
levels usually do not respond at the same rate, and many
organisms become increasingly mismatched with their
food supply. In this context, central questions relate to
how organisms adjust the timing of their life cycles to a
changing world: Which environmental factors do they
rely on to time their seasonal events like reproduction?
Which components of the reproductive axis do these
environmental factors inuence?
Job description
The postdoc will take part in an on-going project in
which we study the trophic relations between birds,
insects, and vegetation. In particular, we investigate
whether blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) use bud devel-
opment of oak trees in spring to predict the peak of
caterpillar abundance (i.e. the main food source for
raising tits' chicks, and the main selection factor for tits'
timing of breeding). This question will be addressed
using a combination of experimental approaches in cap-
tivity, as well as eld studies in several wild populations
of blue tits that have been monitored for 20 to 40 years.
First, the successful candidate will link small-scale ge-
ographic variation in bud development of trees with
variation in reproductive decisions of individual blue
tits using remote-sensing imagery and eld observa-
tions, and test the tness consequences of matching the
phenology of trees. Second, the postdoc will identify
the main volatile components emitted by tree buds in
spring. (S)he will then study whether birds are able to
detect those compounds in a Y-maze apparatus, and
test whether their reproductive behaviours and physiol-
ogy are modulated accordingly (reproductive hormones,
etc.). Third, time permitting, the postdoc might alsoOctober 1, 2017 EvolDir 101
investigate whether the inuence of vegetation develop-
ment on timing of breeding occurs through the ingestion,
rather than the smell, of compounds present in growing
tree buds, using a similar experimental approach as
above.
Requirements
We are seeking a highly motivated candidate with a
strong track record, who is willing to start a truly inter-
disciplinary study. The candidate should have interest
and/or experience in behavioural ecology (behavioural
tests), plant and animal physiology (tree development
and avian endocrinology), spatial analyses (satellite im-
age processing), and chemical ecology (characterization
of plant volatile emissions). It is not necessary to have
experience in all these elds, but the candidate should
be interested in, and not afraid of, mixing these dif-
ferent approaches and techniques. Multi-tasking and
organisational skills will be necessary and appreciated.
Location
The position will be held at the CEFE (Centre
d'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive, UMR 5175), a
leading research institute in Ecology of the CNRS
(Centre National de la Recherche Scientique), sit-
uated at Montpellier, France. Montpellier has
recently been ranked world second best for re-
search in Ecology (http://www.shanghairanking.com/-
Shanghairanking-Subject-Rankings/ecology.html), it is
thus an ideal place for studies in the eld, with many
opportunities to interact with forefront scientists.
Conditions of employment
This is a temporary position for two years, full-time
employment. Gross salary will be of minimum 31k eper
year, which is comfortable in France.
The project and position are funded by an ANR grant
(Agence Nationale de la Recherche, the main research
funding agency in France). The grant will cover the
salary of the postdoc, his/her research, as well as partic-
ipation to conferences. Training will mainly be provided
by Samuel Caro (Behavioural Ecologist and Physiolo-
gist), but also by other scientists present at the CEFE
who are involved in the project: Francesco Bonadonna
(Behavioural Ecologist), Micha el Staudt (Plant Ecolo-
gist and Physiologist) and Anne Charmantier (Evolu-
tionary Ecologist).
Application:
Application to Samuel Caro (samuel.caro@cefe.cnrs.fr)
should include a CV, a list of publications, a letter of
motivation as well as contact details of at least 2 possible
references.
Deadline for applying: October 25, 2017. Start of em-ployment: January 2, 2018.

CornellU 2 EvolutionSocialBehavior
The Sheehan lab (sheehanlab.weebly.com) at Cornell
University is looking to recruit 2 postdocs to work on
projects to understand the genomic and neural basis
of individual facial recognition in paper wasps. Among
its close relatives, the paper wasp Polistes fuscatus is
unique in that it uses highly variable facial patterns
to recognize individuals. The recent evolution of this
complex behavior, coupled with small genomes and very
high recombination rates make paper wasps an unusu-
ally tractable systems for investigating the genetic basis
of behavioral and cognitive evolution.
We are currently seeking postdocs to begin work on two
inter-related aspects of a recently funded project:
1. The evolution of neural architecture underlying social
cognition
Using a combination of staining, imaging and recording
techniques the postdoc will determine regions of the
wasp brain that are involved in processing individually
distinctive facial signals.
For this aspect of the work, prior experience working
with insect neurobiology is strongly desired.
2. Population, comparative and functional genomic
approaches to identifying the genomic basis of social
cognition
Preliminary work in the lab has identied a number of
narrowly dened candidate regions under selection that
have likely been evolving in response to selection for
novel cognitive abilities related to individual recognition
in P. fuscatus. We are now interested to further charac-
terize their eects on brain development or processing.
For this aspect of the work, prior experience working in
genomics is highly desirable.
Start dates for positions are exible. Funding is available
now, though I would anticipate start dates after January
or even into the summer. In both cases, postdocs in the
lab will be encouraged to develop independent projects
related to the broader goals of the lab on the evolution
of social behavior.
If the neural and/or genomic basis of social cognition is
interesting to you, please be in touch!102 EvolDir October 1, 2017

PostDoc: Bioinformatic analysis of genomic and func-
tional diversity of coral holobiont from Tara Pacic
expedition.
SCIENTIFIC CONTEXT: Although covering only
0.02% of the ocean's surface, coral reefs harbour 25%
of ocean biodiversity. They provide direct livelihood in
terms of food and ecological services from coral reefs
(sheries, tourism and coastal protection) are estimated
at about 30 billion USD per year. Recent estimates
indicate that about 20% of reefs have disappeared for-
ever, 25% are in grave danger and an additional 25%
will be threatened by 2050 [1].| In this context, Tara
Pacic expedition (2016-2018) aims to understand the
evolution of coral reefs [2]. This expedition is unique
by the large geographical area covered: 35 islands inthe Pacic Ocean, and by the breadth of the sampling:
about 40 000 samples of water, shes and corals. Fol-
lowing the success of protocols and results obtained
during Tara Oceans expedition [3,4], a similar DNA
and RNA sequencing program in the Genoscope has
been established in order to analyse at a molecular level
the diversity and the activity of the coral holobiont at
each sampling location. Genomic analyses of coral reef
ecosystems at the oceanic scale provide new approaches
to study their capacities of resistance, adaptation and
resilience to environmental change.
PROJET: The post-doc will have in charge to analyse
metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data of three rep-
resentative coral species(Millepora platyphylla, Pocillo-
pora meandrina and Porites lobata) as well as planktonic
eukaryotes surrounding coral colonies. Two dierent
aspects of coral reef biology should be addressed in this
project: 1) Transcriptional activity of coral holobiont in
each sample will be analysed to understand the regula-
tion of key genes in relation to the geographic location
and the activity of planktonic communities around the
colony. 2) In collaboration with other teams of Tara
pacic, a global analysis of genomic variations between
coral samples| will be realized in order to nd genes
under selective pressure without a priori and to study
population structure within and between sampling sites.
The candidate will address these questions taking envi-
ronmental (e.g. ocean temperature, acidity) and coral
trait data into account to identify drivers of adaptation
and selection.
TEAM: The candidate will work in the Laboratory of
Genomic Analysis of Eukaryotes (LAGE), part of the
Genoscope at Evry in France, in a team of 15 researchers
and students led by Patrick Wincker working on several
Tara projects. The project will lead to close collab-
orations with several scientic teams of Tara Pacic
consortium.
CONTRACT: The position will start in January 2018
for 24 month. The salary is based on the CEA salary
grid and depends of qualications and experience.
PROFIL: -||| PhD in bioinformatics, genomic or
biology. -||| A strong background in NGS manip-
ulation (Metagenomics and/or large datasets). -|||

Title:| Postdoctoral Fellowship in Evolutionary Ge-
nomics School: Faculty of Arts and Sciences De-
partment/Area: OEB Position Description: Gene
ow between buttery species in the Amazon URL:
https://academicpositions.harvard.edu/postings/7826
The James Mallet Group seeks two Postdoctoral Fellows
to investigate the causes and genomic eects of gene
ow among species of the buttery genus Heliconius.
We have recently identied a number cases of hybridiza-
tion and introgression among a group of closely related
species of Heliconius butteries. In one publication
(Simon Martin et al. 2013, Genome Research), we
documented that up to 42% of the genome had been
exchanged between a pair of occasionally hybridizing
species. We now have unpublished evidence from a
dierent pair of Heliconius from the Amazon for an
even more extraordinary case. Up to 98% of the ge-
netic material has been exchanged between these two
species, leading to very low divergence across most of the
genome, punctuated by scattered \genomic islands" of
high divergence. In these Heliconius, and in the Anophe-
les gambiae group of malaria mosquitoes, introgression
has swamped the original signal of speciation history,
giving a highly misleading impression of phylogenetic
relationships across most of the genome.
We aim to understand how this situation could be main-
tained, and the \speciation genes" involved in keeping
such species apart. Genes for dierences in ight be-
havior, ecology and host plant use, pheromones, mating
behavior, and genes involved in female hybrid sterility
are all of interest. We need to understand the population
genetics of the interactions between the species, both
empirically via analysis of genome data and functional
analysis, and in theory. In doing so, we will advancethe understanding of speciation with gene ow, and
of introgression among species. It is hoped to apply
this understanding to very similar situations among the
African malaria mosquitoes and other disease vectors.
Basic Qualications Requirements: - Candidates must
have completed their PhD in biology (biology, molecu-
lar biology, integrative biology or similar); - Relevant
experience in population genetics, genomics, functional
genetics, and/or data analysis; - A record of scientic
publications
Additional Qualications The successful applicants will
have: - An interest in evolution and population genetics
- Laboratory skills, especially in functional genetics or
next-generation sequencing - Bioinformatics, statistics,
and data analysis skills. Knowledge of population ge-
netic theory - Good communication skills, both written
and oral - Field experience is not required, but could be
helpful
Special Instructions Materials should include: - A cover
letter (2 pages maximum) describing your research ex-
perience and motivation, with special attention to your
training in ecological statistical modeling; - Curriculum
vitae; - Up to three relevant scientic publications on
which you were an author; - Names, addresses and email
addresses for three referees

HebrewUJerusalem
MethodsHumanPopulationGenetics
A position is available for a post-doctoral fellow at Shai
Carmi's research group at the Hebrew University of
Jerusalem in Israel. The lab is computational, focusing
on statistical and population genetics. It is located at
the Hebrew University medical campus, in a scenic area
at the outskirts of Jerusalem.
The research project will involve the development and
application of statistical methods for reconstructing de-
mographic events based on human modern and ancient
genetic variation. One aim is to improve the modeling
of the eect of founder events on the number and length
of \identical-by-descent" haplotypes (long genomic seg-
ments that are nearly identical between individuals due
to recent co-ancestry). Other aims are to develop new
methods for inferring the parameters of complex admix-
ture events and for modeling the ancestry of ancient
genomes. In all projects, methods will be tested and ap-
plied on large-scale datasets from the Jewish and other
Israeli populations.
Other projects in the lab are in medical genetics: as-
sociation studies, imputation, technologies for carrier
testing, and genetic risk prediction. The lab has access
to high performance computing and enjoys collabora-
tions with a wide network of computational biologists,
physicians, and computer scientists.
For more details on the lab, please visit http://-
scarmilab.org . Requirements for the position are
formal education or research experience in a quanti-
tative eld, experience in programming for computa-
tional biology (Linux, R/Matlab, and preferably one of
Python, C/C++/Java, etc.), an excellent publication
track record, and a solid understanding of probability
and statistics. Background in population genetics is an
advantage.

IGFL Lyon EvoDevo
The team of Michalis Averof, at the Institut de
G enomique Fonctionnelle de Lyon (IGFL) in France, is
recruiting a post-doctoral researcher with expertise in
transcriptional proling and data analysis. The project
will explore fundamental questions on regeneration, in-
cluding the identity and evolutionary relationships of
progenitor cells, the cellular diversity that these gener-
ate, and whether the process of regeneration mirrors
the mechanism of leg development in the embryo. The
project is funded by an ERC Advanced Grant.
The project will involve analyzing large datasets of bulk
and single-cell transcriptomes during the course of limb
regeneration. The research will be carried out in the crus-
tacean Parhyale hawaiensis, a new model that combines
good regenerative ability with genetic tractability and
live imaging (seeScience 343: 788-791, eLife 5: e19766).
The Parhyale genome sequence and regenerating limb
transcriptomes are already available(eLife 5: e20062).
Candidates should have a strong background in genome-
wide computational analysis, including coding skills for
data analysis and statistics. Previous experience with
single-cell RNAseq and/or transcriptomics in non-model
organisms would be an advantage. Laboratory skills
(or a wish to acquire them) would allow the recruited
candidate to generate his/her own data.
The researcher will be integrated in the Averof lab
(www.averof-lab.org),in the new laboratories of the
IGFL at the ~Acole Normale Sup erieure de Lyon,an
exciting environment for research at the interface of
development, physiology, evolution and genomics. The
working language of the team is English.
The researcher will receive a salary and health/social
security coverage from the CNRS. The contract will
be initially for one or two years, with possible exten-
sions until the end of the project (December 2021).The
starting date is negotiable.
This call has an open deadline; applications will be ex-
amined until the relevant position is lled. Potential
applicants are encouraged to contact Michalis Averof as
early as possible, sending a brief description of interests
and a CV to michalis.averof@ens-lyon.fr.

HumanPopulationGenetics
Post-doc in Human Population Genetics, Eco-
Anthropology, Paris A one-year post-doctoral position
starting in November 2017 is available in the Human
Population Genetics group at MNHN (Museum National110 EvolDir October 1, 2017
d'Histoire Naturelle), Paris. The project is aimed at
exploring the biological and cultural factors inuencing
mate choice in Humans using genomic data. Mate choice
in humans is mainly under the inuence of socio-cultural
factors, but previous works (Chaix 2008; Laurent 2012a;
Laurent 2012b) suggest that some biological factors such
as the MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex), as
well as other regions of the genome (Laurent 2012c),
may also inuence mate choice.
Previous studies have been performed on samples of
small sizes from a restricted number of populations.
Here we aim at extending this research to new samples.
We have developed a powerful methodological framework
enabling to detect similarities or dierences between hus-
bands and wives from genomic data. This framework
allows distinguishing biological factors that leave local
genomic signatures, from socio-cultural factors (such
as cousin marriages or a tendency for geographical en-
dogamy) that leave genome-wide signatures. We wish
to explore new population samples, more precisely sev-
eral hundreds of couples sampled in Central Asia and
South-East Asia in populations having dierent social
organizations.
The ideal candidate will have expertise in population
genomics and/or bioinformatics, a solid background in
statistics and computing (R, python, ; ) and a strong
interest in social sciences.
To apply, please send a cover letter detailing experi-
ence and research interests, a current CV, and con-

ImmunePathogenCoevolution
Postdoctoral position to study immune-pathogen coevo-
lution
The Max Planck Research Group (MPRG) \Statis-
tical Physics of Evolving Systems", led by Dr. Ar-
mita Nourmohammad is oering a postdoctoral position
at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-
organization (MPIDS) in G ottingen, Germany. The
institute has strong ties with the George August Uni-
versity of G ottingen, which is the largest university in
Germany. There are a number of groups at MPIDS with
interests in biological systems, fostering an ideal environ-
ment for interdisciplinary research. Moreover, the newly
established International Max Planck Research School
for Genome Science at the G ottingen campus provides
many opportunities for collaborations at the interface of
biophysics and genomics. The focus of our group is on
out-of-equilibrium processes in evolutionary systems by
combining mathematical modeling and inference from
molecular data.
Job Description Similar to the evolution of organisms
adapting to their environment, rapid evolution of cellu-
lar populations occurs within our bodies, as the adaptive
immune system works to eliminate infections. Chronic
pathogens, such as HIV, are able to persist in a host for
extended periods of time, during which they also evolve
to evade the immune response. Our goal is to character-
ize the mode and tempo of somatic co-evolution of the
adaptive immune repertoire together with chronically
infecting pathogens, within individuals. This project
requires development of inference technique for out-of-
equilibrium coevolutionary processes, and application
of such methods to molecular sequence data of antibod-
ies and pathogens collected over time from individuals.October 1, 2017 EvolDir 111
This data is often a highly under-sampled representa-
tion of the underlying distributions. Statistical inference
is necessary to characterize the evolutionary dynamics
based on such incomplete information. The goal is to
identify the molecular signatures of coevolution, and
ultimately, to predict the fate of an antibody or a viral
sequence, dependent on the accumulated information of
their interacting evolutionary histories.
Requirements For this interdisciplinary project we seek
an enthusiastic postdoctoral candidate with background
in topics related to statistical / theoretical physics, math-
ematical biology or population genetics, and preferably
(but not required) familiarity with genomic data analy-
sis. The ideal candidate should be motivated, curious,
and analytically and numerically competent.
The position will be open from November 1st onwards.
The contract will be limited to one year with potential
for extension.
Interested candidates should contact armi-
tan.applications@gmail.com with a CV, publication list,
a brief description of their research experience and why
they are interested in this project, and a list of people
whom I can contact for references.

PredictabilityOfEvolution
IDENTIFYING KEY FACTORS INVOLVED IN PRE-
DICTABILITY OF EVOLUTION One full-time re-
search fellow position, 3 years Project reference: 217355
Ever since Darwin, understanding how life has evolved
in interaction with the environment has been at the fore-
front of science. More recently, however, the emphasis
has shifted to a forward-looking perspective of evolution,
aiming at understanding how species can adapt, in an
evolutionary sense, to current and future changes of
their world.
Predicting evolution requires a deep understanding of
the evolutionary processes across dierent levels of bi-
ological organisation and scale. The eld of evolu-
tionary genetics/ecology/biology has made considerable
progress towards this understanding. Crucially, pro-
pelled by technological advances in modelling, bioinfor-
matics and molecular genetics, the role of non-genetic
forms of inheritance, genomic networks and the feed-
back between organisms and their environments, can
be addressed. Although these aspects are increasingly
recognized to be important for adaptation and transmis-
sion of information to the next generation, but predicted
eects on evolutionary trajectories remain to be estab-
lished.
The Dutch research community has developed a
Roadmap towards Predicting Evolution to align the
on-going research and to look ahead to the next 15-20
years. We are therefore recruiting a Fellow to carry
out a Pathnder project to proceed on this road. The
Pathnder project's aims are (i) to generate new in-
sights by addressing the possibilities and challenges of
predicting evolution, (ii) to strengthen the research com-
munity in the Netherlands around this theme, and (iii)
to further shape and develop the Roadmap. In a joint
eort the research community has dened the contours
of this Pathnder project, described here.The Fellow will investigate what factors are of key im-
portance for the predictability of evolution, including
(i) components of the genomic architecture (Genotype-
Phenotype map) such as epistatic interactions and the
complexity of the gene regulatory network underlying
the phenotype, as well as the standing genetic variation,
(ii) the characteristics of the abiotic and biotic drivers
of selection and (iii) the traits to be predicted.
The rst step is to make predictions about the rela-
tive importance of the dierent factors using theoretical
modelling. This theoretical work will be carried out in
complement with a set of experimental studies, which
will address the same factors empirically and can vali-
date the predictions.
To facilitate building a research community in the
Netherlands around predicting evolution, the empiri-
cal work will be carried out by a large number of Dutch
research groups, using a single model system*. All
participating groups will be invited to run a standard-
ized experimental evolution experiment and to run one
or more variants of this experiment, for instance vary-
ing the same factors as used in the theoretical work
described above (incl. experiments under natural condi-
tions). The fellow will be involved both in the theoretical
and the empirical work and will be instrumental in inte-
grating these two components. Furthermore, the Fellow
will coordinate the experiments of the dierent research
groups. The Fellow will perform a meta-analysis on
the results and will link the empirical results with the
outcome of the theoretical work.
*A suitable experimental system would be Caenorhab-
ditis remanei as it is likely that many groups could use
this system to address questions which link to their own
research. This species is relatively easy to culture with
fast generation times, has sexual reproduction, com-
putational models exist, and it is possible to include
evolutionary processes in wild populations. By focussing
on a single system, the results can be analysed in a single
analysis by the Fellow.
QUALIFICATIONS The successful candidate will have:
- a PhD in a relevant eld as indicated above - an
excellent track record as shown by publications, invi-
tations, awards and honorary positions - a clear vision
on evolutionary processes, and thorough expertise in
modelling and/or experimental evolution research - the
ambition, resourcefulness, perseverance and- cooperative
skills needed to bring the project to a successful closure.
- strong communication skills both towards direct collab-
orators and towards the wider research community - an
interest in science communication targeted at a variety
of audiences - excellent written and oral knowledge of
English.October 1, 2017 EvolDir 113

Three ERC-funded postdoctoral positions in fungal ge-
nomics, bioinformatics and evolution
Applications are invited for 3 postdoctoral positions by116 EvolDir October 1, 2017
candidates with an interest in pursuing groundbreaking
research on the evolution of multicellularity and organis-
mal complexity and its relationship to the cis-regulatory
genome in fungi. The projects use fungi as a model sys-
tem and employ various molecular biology, NGS-based,
genetic engineering, single-cell RNA and phylogenetic
approaches.
The Project
The aim of the project is to understand the general
principles of the evolution of complex multicellularity in
fungi as a model system. What genomic prerequisites
does the evolution of complex multicellularity (and in-
creased organismal complexity in general) have? How
does cis-regulatory evolution contribute to the evolu-
tion of novel phenotype? What is the genetic toolkit of
fruiting body development in fungi? Are there major
patterns of genome-evolution associated with the multi-
cellularity? The project aims to test broad hypotheses
related to the above questions using a combination of
state of the art experimental and computational ap-
proaches.
The Candidates
The successful candidates are highly motivated, experi-
enced in and capable of developing protocols and work-
ows for one or combinations of the above-mentioned
approaches (with help from the PI), have good problem
solving and team player skills. The position involves
working independently and with other members of the
research team, and provides the opportunity to interact
with the wide knowledge base in molecular and sys-
tems biology at the Synthetic and Systems Biology Unit
(http://group.szbk.u-szeged.hu/sysbiol/). Experience
in RNA-Seq, the CRISPR/Cas9 system, genetic manip-
ulation of lamentous fungi, in vitro protein expression
or phylogenetics/genomics is a plus.
The Lab
The successful candidate will join the Fungal Genomics
and Evolution lab (http://group.szbk.u-szeged.hu/-
sysbiol/nagy-laszlo-lab-overview.html) recently funded
by the European Research Council (project duration:
2018-2023). The Lab is part of the Synthetic and Sys-
tems Biology Unit of the Institute of Biochemistry, BRC-
HAS, a vibrant systems and evolutionary biology re-
search unit, comprising young PI-s and an inspiring
atmosphere. It is located in Szeged, a mediterranean-
feeling city in southeast Hungary, centered around a
strong pedigree in higher education (the University of
Szeged has ca. 30000 students), providing an inspiring
and welcoming environment for open-minded postdocs.

UBern 4PDF PhD
EvolutionCooperation
4 PhD- and postdoc positions are available at the Uni-
versity of Bern, to study the
Evolution of cooperation based on relatedness, negotia-
tion and trading
All major transitions in the evolution of life are char-October 1, 2017 EvolDir 117
acterized by the necessity of cooperation and sacrice
of constituent parts transforming into higher complex-
ity. Conceptually, the evolution of cooperation seems
to be well understood. However, critical tests of the
predictions from alternative mechanisms responsible for
the establishment of evolutionarily stable levels of coop-
eration hardly exist. For instance, the seemingly over-
whelming evidence for the importance of kin selection to
the evolution of altruism is almost entirely correlational.
Few studies have manipulated relatedness and measured
behavioural responses and corresponding tness eects,
and several have found that relatedness in fact hampers
cooperative behaviour instead of promoting it, opposite
to predictions from kin selection theory. The relative
signicance of alternative mechanisms in addition to kin
selection, such as negotiation and reciprocal trading, to
explain cooperation in nature is as yet unclear. In this
project we aim to develop and experimentally test pre-
dictions regarding the relative and interactive inuence
of relatedness and negotiation/trading on cooperation
between social partners.
Our previous work has suggested that mutual help and
trading of service and commodities are important and
widespread variants of cooperative interactions among
animals, which can elicit high levels of evolutionary
stable cooperation. A crucial parameter in reciprocal
trading is the potential time delay between subsequent
interactions among social partners, because this aects
the perceived or true probability to receive returns for
provided help. One aim of this project will be to vary
the time axis of social decisions between concurrency
and delays of dierent magnitude to span the entire
range from coaction to long-term reciprocity. Another
important issue is that in nature most social interac-
tions involve some sort of asymmetry between concerned
individuals, regardless whether this is sex, age, domi-
nance status, body condition, individual quality, need,
resource holding potential, reproductive status, residual
reproductive value, etc. Consequently, in virtually any
social interaction the involved individuals have dierent
abilities and expectations about potential pay-os from
the interaction. The current project aims to experimen-
tally scrutinize the signicance of asymmetries for the
negotiation process between social partners about their
respective cooperative eort.
Hitherto, eects of experimental manipulation of cooper-
ation on direct and indirect components of tness have
hardly been scrutinized. We aim at estimating tness ef-
fects of experimentally controlled cooperative behaviour
in natural and semi-natural settings by manipulating at
the same time relatedness and the negotiation rules ap-
plied by all involved parties. Our model organisms will
be wild-type Norway rats and cooperatively breedingLake Tanganyika cichlids.
Within the framework of this SNF-funded project, we
oer one post-doc and three PhD-positions. We seek
highly-motivated and well organised candidates who
can work independently as well as drive collaborative
projects. Scientic curiosity is a must and good English
language skills are important. Previous experience with
studying animal behaviour is mandatory. The PhD-
applicants will need an MSc-degree (or equivalent) in
biology. Applications must include a letter of motiva-

recommendation letter separately before the mentioned
deadline. Applications should be submitted before

UCLondon Multivariate yeast

Postdoctoral Research Associate at University College
London
The eects of genetics, mutation and selection on Evo-
lutionary Rescue in complex environments
We are looking for a postdoctoral research associate to
work with Max Reuter and J urg B ahler at University
College London. The position is available for three years
and funded by a grant from the BBSRC, which also
includes Daniel Jeares (University of York) and Doug
Speed (UCL Genetics Institute) as collaborators.
The project will study how the interplay between ge-
netics and evolutionary forces shapes the capacity of
populations to show rapid adaptive responses. The
project will use high-throughput phenotyping, genomics
and quantitative genetics in ssion yeast to investigate
the genetic basis of growth responses to dierent envi-
ronmental gradients (salinity, temperature), and estab-
lish how genetic correlations between responses arise
from overlap in genetic pathways. We will then asses
how mutation and selection acting within these genetic
constraints shape standing genetic variation and how
this, in turn, aects population survival in the face of
sudden shifts in their multivariate environment. The
project thus combines fundamental evolutionary con-
cepts with functional genetic aspects that are accessible
in a tractable microbial model. The results will be rel-
evant in the context of sudden, strong selection, be it
in relation to climate change, antibiotic treatments or
agricultural pest control.
The postdoctoral research associate will interact with
both the groups of Max Reuter, working on evolu-
tionary constraints on phenotypic adaptation (http:/-
/www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/ ~ucbtmre/Labsite), and
J urg B ahler, working on genome regulation (http:/-
/www.bahlerlab.info/home/). Both are based in UCL's
Research Department of Genetics, Evolution and En-
vironment, which oers a stimulating and interactive
environment across the elds of evolutionary and humangenetics to biodiversity research. Further aeld, UCL
oers a great diversity of world-class research right in
the centre of London.
The position is an opportunity for a highly motivated,
ambitious and independent individual. The candidate
will have (or be about to obtain) a PhD in a relevant
discipline, a strong interest in evolutionary genetics
and/or microbiology, proven research skills (as evident
in publication record and prior research ndings), experi-
ence in relevant approaches (such as quantitative genet-
ics/genomics, molecular microbiology, high-throughput
phenotyping, statistics) and excellent verbal and written
communication skills.
The post is available from 1st November 2017 (nego-
tiable) for up to 36 months, with a starting salary be-
tween 34,045 (31,076 plus 2,980 London Allowance) and
41,163 per annum (38,183 plus 2,980 London Allowance),
depending on experience. In line with UCL regulation,
candidates who have not yet obtained their PhD will be
paid at a lower grade until the date of their nal thesis
submission.

UIdaho ModellingEvol
Multiple Openings for Postdoctoral Fellows at the Uni-
versity of Idaho
We seek to hire three postdoctoral fellows-two model-
ing and one empirical-to join our research team at the
University of Idaho. The two modeling postdocs will
be housed within the Center for Modeling Complex In-
teractions (CMCI). CMCI is funded by the National
Institutes of Health and serves as an epicenter for re-
search at the university. The central concept behind
CMCI is that by housing modelers in proximity to each
other and having them interact regularly with empiri-
cists, synergies will emerge that drive research. For all
three postdocs, we seek individuals who are creative in
applying their skills to new problems, who are good atOctober 1, 2017 EvolDir 125
communicating across disciplines, and who sees them-
selves thriving in our highly collaborative environment.
Researchers from CMCI, in collaboration with faculty
from Brown University and the University of Vermont
were recently awarded a major NSF EPSCoR grant
with the goal of using biophysical protein models to
map genetic variation to phenotypes. The empirical
postdoc position will work on this NSF grant, in close
collaboration with modelers from CMCI and researchers
at Brown and Vermont.
For the two CMCI modeling postdocs, we are interested
in applicants with many potential skill sets, including
but not limited to: applied mathematics and mathemat-
ical biology (e.g., dynamical systems, PDEs, stochastic
processes), systems biology, ecological modeling, statisti-
cal modeling, epidemiology, computer programming and
novel package development, bioinformatics, and molecu-
lar modeling. Postdocs are expected to integrate into
one or more CMCI workings groups. These groups are
diverse and evolving. Some current examples include:
studying the pathogenic eects of viral co-infection in
drosophila and mice; modeling spectral shifts in opsin
proteins; modeling how human social dynamics, e.g.
peer inuences on vaccination rates, generates feedback
with disease dynamics; using microbiome data to model
population dynamics of microbial communities; and
modeling reproducibility in science.
The empirical postdoc will initially carry out lab work
to assess how mutations in the fusion glycoprotein of
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) aect protein stability
and antibody anity and neutralization. The goal of
the project is to combine molecular and mathematical
modeling with empirical research to develop a framework
for predicting how mutations - alone, in combination,
and in dierent environments - inuence protein stabil-
ity, anity for substrates and partners, and mapping
to higher-level phenotypes. The empirical work will
include the generation and characterization of mutation
libraries in an RSV infectious clone and biochemical
analyses of mutant fusion glycoproteins and antibod-
ies. Collaboration with molecular and mathematical
modelers will determine how well models can predict an-
tibody escape. In time, this project will be extended to
additional systems being studied at Idaho. We seek ap-
plicants with molecular biology and protein biochemistry
skills, including targeted mutagenesis, high throughput
molecular techniques, and protein expression.
All three positions will be located at the Univer-
sity of Idaho in Moscow. The empirical post-
doc will work in the labs of Tanya Miura (http://-
www.webpages.uidaho.edu/miuralab/) and Paul Rowley
(https://www.rowleylab.com/) in Biological Sciences
and the modeling postdocs will be located within CMCI.CMCI is in a gorgeous, 3000 ft2 space on the top oor of
the University of Idaho's new agship research building,
the Integrated Research Innovation Center. The Univer-
sity of Idaho is only eight miles from Washington State
University in Pullman, Washington, providing an aca-
demically and culturally rich community. Moscow is a
friendly mid-sized town on the rolling hills of the Palouse,
with great parks, bike paths, restaurants, farmer's mar-
ket and fantastic opportunities for recreation in the adja-
cent mountains and rivers. For more information about

and https://www.ci.moscow.id.us/.
To apply, submit to cmci@uidaho.edu : 1) a letter of
application specifying which position (empirical or mod-
eling) you are interested in and how you t the job
requirements; 2) a CV; 3) contact information for three

EvolutionaryGenomics
Program announcement: Genome-to-phenome connec-
tions in wild populations
We are pleased to announce the establishment of a new
collaborative research and training network created to
advance evolutionary and ecological genomics in natu-
ral populations. The UNVEIL network (Using Natural
Variation to Educate, Innovate, and Lead) is funded
by a recent NSF EPSCoR award, and brings togetherOctober 1, 2017 EvolDir 129
researchers from the University of Montana and the
University of Nebraska. The network seeks to advance
our understanding of the genetic basis of tness-related
traits in wild populations and to train the next genera-
tion of integrative biologists to solve pressing societal
challenges in ecological and conservation genomics.
https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/-
showAward?AWD ID=1736249 The research and
training activities of the UNVEIL network will center
around three core projects, which are united by their
conceptual focus on adaptation to spatiotemporal
environmental variation - high altitude adaptation
and hypoxia resistance in deer mice, adaptation to
climate change in snowshoe hares and other species
that undergo seasonal phenotypic changes, and thermal
adaptation in yellow monkeyowers. Network members
and trainees will work collaboratively on these projects
to meet the following goals:
1. Advance the science of genome-to-phenome connec-
tions through the development of novel approaches for
the integration of functional and genomic data.
2. Develop ethical guidelines for the application of ge-
nomic interventions for wildlife conservation.
3. Create a unique interdisciplinary training environ-
ment to broaden participation in the STEM workforce,
and to train integrative biologists that are both tech-
nically and ethically equipped to leverage genomic ap-
proaches to solve ecological and conservation challenges.
In the coming years, the network will provide a variety of
opportunities that may be of interest to the community:
Postdoctoral Fellowships: Over the next four years, we
will fund four postdoctoral fellowships within the net-
work. We anticipate lling two of these positions this
year. In addition to a competitive salary and bene-
ts package, fellows will be provided generous research
funds ( $50,000; $25,000/year over two years) to allow
them the freedom to creatively extend the core projects
in novel directions or to work on complementary ques-
tions in independent experimental systems with active
mentorship from one or more members of the UNVEIL
network.
Graduate Student Research Assistantships: We will
also fund graduate student research assistantships on
both campuses. Two UNVEIL Diversity Fellowships
will be available in the Fall of 2018 and will support one
graduate fellow on each campus for a three-year tenure.
Additional research assistantships will be available for
students to work on aspects of the core projects outlined
above.
Annual symposia: Finally, to aid in the exchange ofideas and to advance research and training activities
both within and beyond the network, we will hold yearly
UNVEIL conferences. These conferences will feature
1.) a scientic program focused on evolutionary and
ecological genomics in wild populations, 2.) technical
and analytical workshops, and 3.) working group ses-
sions to develop ethical frameworks for the application
of genomic interventions for wildlife conservation. We
anticipate broad participation from biologists, philoso-
phers, and land managers in the ethics working groups
and these sessions will serve as catalysis meetings to
formulate policy position white papers, synthesis papers
for academic audiences, and ethics training materials.
Specic announcements of all of these activities will be
disseminated periodically as deadlines approach, but
interested postdoctoral and graduate fellowship candi-
dates are strongly encouraged to contact one or more of
the following UNVEIL PIs to discuss these opportunities

able genomes. We are interested in developing context-
dependent models of genome variation to boost the
performance of association analyses. Our methodology
will be applied to a range bacteria including those with
commensal lifestyles, those involved in chronic infection,
or hypervirulent strains. We aim to use our results
to predict the pathogenic potential of bacteria using
genome sequence alone.
The successful candidate will join a research group that
has a broad range of interests including the applica-
tion of bioinformatic methods to analyse comparative
genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic datasets. In
particular we are interested in RNA biology and the

Project description: Study the evolution and specic
adaptations to parasitism in Ascetosporea, an emerg-
ing threat in marine environments that has remained
beyond reach of modern molecular tools. Ascetosporea
is a collection of poorly characterized microbial eukary-
ote parasites of marine invertebrates. It is best-known
for including deadly pathogens of oysters and mussels,
costing millions of dollars to the growing aquaculture
industry. To date, however, Ascetosporea is absent from
models describing the evolution of parasites because
comparative genomic data is lacking. This is due to
multiple factors, including minute cell size, obligate in-
tracellular lifestyle, lack of suitable host cell lines, and
techniques for in vitro culture. Here, we propose to
overcome these challenges by using micromanipulation
and single-cell genomic/transcriptomic methods. We
will sequence de novo the genome and transcriptome of
several uncultured parasites encompassing the diversity
of Ascetosporea, as well as their closest free-living out-
groups. With these data, we will broadly look at the
evolution of parasitism in Ascetosporea, i.e. identify
pre-parasitic conditions, ancestral parasitic innovations,
and lineage-specic adaptations using comparative ge-
nomics.
Requirements: Doctoral degree, or an equivalent foreign
degree, in Biology. To be qualied for an appointment
as a postdoctoral fellow you must hold a doctorate or
a foreign degree equivalent to a doctorate, and have
completed the degree within three years before the ap-
plication deadline. In special circumstances, the PhD
can have been completed earlier, including leave of ab-
sence due to sickness, parental leave, etc.October 1, 2017 EvolDir 133
Additional qualications: Highly motivated individual
with strong academic prociency within the eld of (mi-
crobial) eukaryote evolution. We are looking for a com-
bination of wet lab and bioinformatic skills: documented
skills in single-cell genomics/transcriptomics and/or mi-
cromanipulation techniques; proven experience in bioin-
formatics to assemble and annotate genomes. Experi-

ods, next-generation sequencing and bioinformatic ap-
proaches to answer fundamental questions in evolution-
ary biology, especially those with practical conservation
applications. Some major questions being asked in the
lab are:
§How do humans inuence the evolution of wildlife?
We study the ways in which climate change, habitat
alteration, and introduced diseases impact the distribu-
tion of genetic variation, the rates of gene ow, and the
probability of adaptation.§What is the genomic basis of rapid adaptation to novel
pathogens? We examine the demographic and environ-
mental constraints to adaptation and whether genomic
architecture of rapid adaptation diers from that of
more gradual adaptation (e.g., to climate).
Please visit the lab website for more details on current
projects: www.cassinsackett.com The postdoc will be
involved in a project that uses genomic approaches to
analyze genetic diversity in prairie dogs and investigate
the potential for resistance to plague. Specic duties
may include: 1) sampling historical museum specimens,
2) developing and optimizing genomic assays (e.g., SNP
capture, highly multiplexed amplicon sequencing), 3)
performing wet lab work to genotype individual prairie
dogs (both modern and historical), 4) conducting bioin-

ModellingEcoEvoDynamics
Postdoctoral position in modelling species' response to
environmental change
University of Zurich, Switzerland 2-year SNSF-funded
position starting January 2018
Deadline for application: 15 October 2017
We seek a strong candidate to model the demographic
and evolutionary responses (eco-evo responses) of (plant)
species to environmental changes at large geographical
scales. The candidate will investigate the ecological and
evolutionary conditions leading to species persistence
when facing rapid climate/environmental changes. The
project will be a mix of evolutionary modelling with the
software Nemo (http://nemo2.sourceforge.net/), ecologi-
cal niche modelling, and population dynamics modelling.
Strong and documented expertise in one of those elds
is required. Preference will go to candidates that have
developed strong computational skills and/or a deep
understanding of eco-evolutionary processes. With this
project, we seek to improve on our current individual-
based modelling approach (http://rdcu.be/rOCD) by
developing new approaches, for e.g. population-based
or multi-species approaches, depending on the candi-
date's background and motivations. Partners and po-
tential collaborators on this project include Prof Arpat
Ozgul (population ecology, UZH), Prof Nick Zimmer-
mann (niche & climate modelling, ETH-WSL), and
Drs. Felix Gugerli and Christian Rellstab (tree genet-136 EvolDir October 1, 2017
ics/genomics, ETH-WSL).
The position is available in Prof Frederic Guillaume's
lab at the Department of Evolutionary Biology and
Environmental Studies, University of Zurich (http://-
www.ieu.uzh.ch/en/research/evolbiol/ecoevo.html). We
oer a competitive working environment in the beautiful
international city of Zurich, one hour from the closest
mountains. The work-related activities are conducted
in English.
Please send your application package as a *single* PDF
to frederic.guillaume@ieu.uzh.ch with your CV, publi-
cation list, a one-page summary of research interests

PlantVirologyBioinformatics
Postdoctoral Position to Explore the Expanding Field
of Plant Virology
Scientic context Sequencing and assembling the
genomes of eukaryotes can help elucidating the evo-
lution of viruses. Indeed, genomes of plants, animals
and protists can contain viral sequences that have been
inserted either by active or by passive integration mech-
anisms and in many cases retained there over extended
periods of time, sometimes millions of years. The study
of endogenous viral elements (EVEs), coined \paleovi-
rology", does allow the evolution of viruses to be traced,
much like a fossil record (Aiewsakun and Katzourakis,2015). For example, the study of endogenous retro-
viruses has enabled to uncover their hidden diversity
and host range, and has provided evidence that retro-
viruses have a marine origin, and that they developed
in parallel with their vertebrate hosts more than 450
million years ago (Hayward et al., 2013) (Hayward et
al., 2015) (Aiewsakun and Katzourakis, 2017). The
Caulimoviridae is one of the ve families of reverse-
transcribing viruses or virus-like retrotransposons that
occur in eukaryotes (Pringle, 1998), and is the only
family of viruses with a double-stranded DNA genome
that infects plants. Unlike retroviruses, Caulimoviri-
dae do not integrate their DNA in the genome of their
host to complete their replication cycle. Nevertheless,
caulimovirid DNA can occasionally integrate their host
genome passively. Using paleovirology approaches, we
have determined that EVEs from several Caulimoviridae
genera are found in virtually all vascular plant genomes,
including ferns, gymnosperms and angiosperms, often
at high copy number (Geering et al., 2014) (Diop et al.,
2017). A major conclusion stemming out from previous
work is that, instead of representing a single element,
endogenous Caulimoviridae often appear to dene com-
plex networks of related sequences with structural and
genetic variants. For instance, Caulimoviridae EVEs
can be re-organized in plant genomes into sequences
capable to generate episomal infection (Gayral et al.,
2008). In addition, several Caulimoviridae genera have
bipartite genomes (Geering et al., 2014) - each viral
genome is dened by two \chromosomes" - but it is
unclear whether this genomic organization has emerged
once or repeatedly. Furthermore, in the oak genome,
we found a very high number of short Caulimoviridae
segments with movement protein domain relative to
the number of full length viral genomes (Plomion et
al., submitted), suggesting that they represent satellite
sequences and so that their duplication relies on the
production of proteins by autonomous entities, either
from exogenous Caulimoviridae, or from endogenous
elements.
Proposed work Combining information from several
endogenous copies enables reconstructing consensus se-
quences that closely determine native elements. To
disentangle the genetic relationships and functional in-
teractions dening these networks, we will perform an
accurate reconstruction of Caulimoviridae and related
EVE sequences in several plant genomes, starting with
species such as oak, vine, and citrus, for which we
have collected exemplary data. The acquired method-
ology will be automatized and transposed to dozens
of plant genomes to identify, characterize and com-
pare Caulimoviridae sequence networks. Comparing
Caulimoviridae networks across plant families with highOctober 1, 2017 EvolDir 137
EVE content and for which a substantial set of genomes
are publicly available (e.g. Solanaceae) or to which we
have access in the context of collaborations (e.g. Ru-
taceae) will allow determining the time of emergence
and performing detailed co-evolution analyses to gain
further insights into the evolution of this complex plant
pathosystem.
Prole §The successful applicant will have a Ph.D in
bioinformatics and substantial experience in the elds
of evolutionary biology, virology or genomics. §He/She
will be familiar with dierent programming languages.
§He/She will be autonomous, creative and dedicated,
and will have good English writing prociency.

Advanced Python for biologists
13-17 November 2017, Berlin (Germany)
https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses/course12/
Instructor: Dr. Martin Jones (founder, Python for
Biologists)
http://www.physalia-courses.org/instructors/t1/ Reg-
istration deadline: 20th October 2017
Overview
Python is a dynamic, readable language that is a popu-
lar platform for all types of bioinformatics work, from
simple one-o scripts to large, complex software projects.
This workshop is aimed at people who already have a
basic knowledge of Python and are interested in using
the language to tackle larger problems. In it, we will
look in detail at the parts of the language which are
particularly useful in scientic programming, and at the
tools Python oers for making development faster and
easier. The workshop will use examples and exercises
drawn from various aspects of bioinformatics work. Af-
ter completing the workshop, students should be in a
position to (1) take advantage of the advanced language
features in their own programs and (2) use appropriate
tools when developing software programs.
Who should attend
This workshop is aimed at researchers and technical
workers with a background in biology and a basic knowl-
edge of Python. The Advanced course is aimed at people
who want to develop bigger or more complicated pro-
grams in Python, or to learn more about the language,
or to explore dierent approaches (object-oriented, func-
tional) to programming. The material covered is very
general purpose and can be applied to any kind of prob-
lem.
Requirements
Students should have enough biological/bioinformatics
background to appreciate the examples and exercise
problems (i.e. they should know what a protein ac-
cession number, BLAST report, and FASTA sequence
is). They should also have basic Python experience
(the Introduction to Python for Biologists course will140 EvolDir October 1, 2017
full these requirements). Students should be familiar
with the use of lists, loops, functions and conditions in
Python and have written at least a few small programs
from scratch.
Session content
Monday 13th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 1: Data structures in Python
In this session we will briey recap Python's basic data
structures, before looking at a couple of new data types
tuples and sets and discussing where each should be
used. We will then see how we can combine these basic
types to make more complex data structures for solving
specic problems. We'll nish our discussion by looking
at specialized data types that are found in the Python
core library. This session will also be our rst intro-
duction to benchmarking as we talk about the relative
performance of dierent data types. In the practical
session we'll learn how to parse an input le into a com-
plex data structure which we can then use to rapidly
query the data. Core concepts introduced: tuples, sets,
higher-order data structures, default dicts, Counters,
big-O notation.
Session 2: Recursion and trees
In this session we will cover two very closely related
concepts: trees (i.e. the various ways that we can store
hierarchical data) and recursive functions (the best way
to operate on treelike data). As recursion is inherently
confusing, we'll start with a gentle introduction using
biological examples before moving on to consider a num-
ber of core tree algorithms concerning parents, children,
and common ancestors. In the practical session we'll
look in detail at one particular way of identifying the
last common ancestor of a group of nodes, which will
give us an opportunity to explore the role of recursion.
Core concepts introduced: nested lists, storing hierar-
chical data, recursive functions, relationship between
recursion and iteration.
Tuesday 14th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 3: Classes and objects
In this session we will introduce the core concepts of
object-oriented programming, and see how the data
types that we use all the time in Python are actually
examples of classes. We'll take a very simple example
and use it to examine how we can construct our own
classes, moving from an imperative style of program-
ming to an object-oriented style. As we do so, we'll
discuss where and when object-orientation is a good
idea. In the practical we will practise writing classes to
solve simple biological problems and familiarize ourselves
with the division of code into library and client thatobject-oriented programming demands. Core concepts
introduced: classes, instances, methods vs. functions,
self, constructors, magic methods.
Session 4: Object-oriented programming
Following on from the previous session, we will go over
some advanced ideas that are common to most object-
oriented programming languages. For each idea we'll
discuss the basic concept, the scenarios in which it's

Course: Geometric Morphometrics
5-9 March 2018, Berlin (Germany):https://-
www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
course22/ Instructor:
Dr. Carmelo Fruciano (Queensland University of Tech-
nology (Brisbane, Australia))
https://www.physalia-courses.org/instructors/t11/
Topic
Introductory and intermediate Geometric Morphomet-
rics.
Overview
Geometric Morphometrics has become a standard in
biological research because it combines statistical rigour
and ease of interpretation. Through geometric morpho-
metrics, biological form is quantied, analysed and the
results are expressed as easily interpretable and visually
impactful shape changes. This course covers the main
common practices of modern geometric morphometrics,
including: acquiring data, analysing it, visualizing and
interpreting the results.
Course Format
The course will be delivered over ve days and will
comprise both lectures and hands-on sessions. The
lectures will cover both basic theoretical aspects and
their practical implementation in research practice and
software. During the hands-on sessions, the attendees
will have the chance of both using example datasetsOctober 1, 2017 EvolDir 141
and applying the knowledge acquired to their own data.
The course will be focused mainly on 2D data and on
easy-to-use software with graphical user interface to
maximize the ability to understand concepts and apply
them. However, some information on 3D data and on
R implementations will be provided, as appropriate.
Who Should Attend
This course is aimed at beginners and intermediate users.
In other words, it is aimed at researchers who intend
to use geometric morphometrics or who have started
performing geometric morphometric analyses but feel
they need a more structured background.
Requirements
Attendees should have a background in biology and a
basic understanding of statistical concepts.

Registration deadline: September 22nd , 2017.
INSTRUCTOR
Dr Jing Hua Zhao (https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
instructors/t20/)
Trained in medicine, medical statistics and statistical ge-
netics, he had worked on statistical and computational
methods for epidemiological and public health studies at142 EvolDir October 1, 2017
several institutions until 2005, when he joined the MRC
Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge, to work on
design and analysis of GWAS such as the EPIC-Norfolk,
the Fenland and the InterAct. He has also participated
in numerous genetic analysis workshops which involve
both simulated and real data such as those from the
Framingham heart study. Besides methodological devel-
opment, data analysis, and other academic activities, he
has also had tutorials on genetic dissection of complex
traits with focus on GWAS at UseR! 2008, 2009, and
2010 Conferences and contributed a Henry-Stewart talk
on genetic association with R.
Overview
The past decade has witnessed an astonishing develop-
ment and the universal use of genome wide association
studies (GWAS) in identication and characterisation
of genetic variants underlying disorders and other varia-
tions in human and other species, which has an immense
impact in biomedical research. This is owing to the abil-
ity to eciently generate and process large quantity
of genetic polymorphisms as well as to integrate with
other sources such as gene expression and methylation.
To tackle challenges in GWAS, a lot of methods and
techniques have been established but many others are
still evolving. The workshop therefore intends to give a
grand picture as well as practical aspects of GWAS.
Targeted audience and assumed background
The purpose of this workshop is to render both a broad
picture and computational details of GWAS to biomed-

Berlin LandscapeGenomics Nov6-10
Course: \Landscape Genomics" https://www.physalia-
courses.org/courses-workshops/course17/ 6-10 Novem-
ber, Berlin (Germany)
Application deadline is: October 6th, 2017.
https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
course17/ Instructors:
1) Dr. St ephane Joost ( Laboratory of Geographic Infor-
mation System (LASIG), Swiss Federal Institute of Tech-
nology of Lausanne (EPFL)). Dr. Joost is specialized in
the contribution of Geographic Information Science for
the conservation of plant and animal genetic resources.
He applies spatial statistics and geocomputation meth-
ods to conservation genetics and landscape genomics
(https://www.physalia- courses.org/instructors/t13/)
2) Oliver Salmoni, MSc (Laboratory of Geographic Infor-
mation System (LASIG), Swiss Federal Institute of Tech-
nology of Lausanne (EPFL)). https://www.physalia-
courses.org/instructors/t24/ Course Overview:
Landscape genomics is an emerging research eld that
studies how genetic diversity distributes across space and
how environmental features can modify this structure
through local adaptation. In this workshop, students
will learn the basics of this approach and train using
state of the art methods. The course will provide an
overview of the type of dataset that can be used for
a landscape genomics analysis. Firstly, students will
learn how to obtain environmental data from publicly
available databases, how to process it with Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) and how to use the latter to
produce indicators able to describe the characteristics
of the landscape. Next, the course will discuss the dier-
ent approaches to obtain genetic data and subsequently
show how to study genetic variation and population
structure across space in the R environment. Students
will be given an overview of the dierent statistical ap-
proaches to study local adaptation, and will be trained
in using two of them, Sambada and LFMM. The course
will also cover the critical task of the interpretation andvalidation of the results. Finally, the workshop will con-
sider the crucial aspects and good habits to account for
when planning a landscape genomics experiment (e.g.
sampling design).
Targeted Audience & Assumed Background:
This workshop is aimed at all biologists, ecologists, ge-
neticists, veterinarians that want to implement the land-
scape genomics approach in their own studies of evo-
lutionary biology and conservation. Even though the
course is not intended for a specialized audience, basic
knowledge in evolutionary biology and population ge-
netics would help. Students will learn how to use GIS,
but basic computer skills are desirable (e.g. in the R
environment). A basic understanding of statistics is also
necessary.
Teaching Format:
The course is organized in ten learning sessions. During
the rst two sessions, the course will provide a contex-
tualization of the research eld. Then, students will be
guided through a landscape genomics experiment with
sessions that couple brief theoretical introductions with
practical work.

Overview:
Next generation sequencing has revolutionized evolu-
tionary biology allowing unprecedented resolution and
insight into evolutionary questions that appeared in-
tractable only a few years ago. The course will cover
the basics of population genomic analysis from SNP
data onwards and will cover the key analyses that may
be required to successfully analyze a population ge-
netic data set. The course will NOT cover steps prior
to generation of a .vcf le or SNP data set such as
NGS data demultiplexing, clustering and SNP calling
(This is covered in detail in the Introduction to RADseq
course). This course will introduce Linux and the com-
mand line environment, basic perl and python usage,
le conversions and manipulation, population structure
and dierentiation in R, outlier analysis, landscape /
seascape genomics and introgression. Having completed
the course, students should have a good understanding
of the software and methods available for population ge-
nomic analysis and be competent in population genomic
analysis.
Intended audience & assumed background:
This workshop is aimed at postgraduate students and
early career researchers who are interested in using pop-
ulation genomic tools in their research. No previous
experience of bioinformatics is required, but an under-
pinning in evolutionary biology and basic population
genetics concepts such as Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium
and FST are desirable. The course will use a range of
software including the Linux operating system and R.

Computable evolutionary phenotype knowledge: a
hands-on workshop
The Phenoscape (http://phenoscape.org) project is host-
ing a hands-on workshop on Dec 11-14, 2017, at Duke
University in Durham, North Carolina.
Evolutionary phenotype data that is amenable to com-
putational data science, including computation-driven
discovery, remains relatively new to science. Therefore
use-cases and applications that eectively exploit these
new capabilities are only beginning to emerge. If you
are interested in discovering, linking to, recombining,
or computing with machine-interpretable evolutionary
phenotypes, this is the workshop for you!
The event will bring together a diverse group of peo-
ple to collaboratively design and work hands-on on
targets of their interest that take advantage and pro-
mote reuse of [Phenoscape]'s online evolutionary data
resources and services. The event is designed as a hands-
on unconference-style workshop. Participants will break
into subgroups to collaboratively tackle self-selected
work targets.

Workshop Announcement: Best practices for using NGS-
based datasets to determine statistically robust evidence
of positive selection and convergent evolution of polar
organisms.
We will conduct a NSF-funded workshop using cross-
disciplinary approaches for determining genetic adap-
tations in polar organisms using Next Generation
Sequencing-based datasets. In particular, this work-150 EvolDir October 1, 2017
shop will focus on the following:
1) Establish collaborative research groups to test for
genes under positive selection from diverse polar organ-
isms using genomic and transcriptomic datasets.
2) Evaluate current analytical methods for determining
positively selected genes and their statistical signi-
cance.
3) Explore current and novel methodologies for detect-
ing genetic modications acquired through convergent
evolution in response to similar environmental condi-
tions.
4) Review lab-based protocols for demonstrating the
potential functions of candidate genes. Specically, we
will focus on techniques amenable to frozen or otherwise
preserved samples that can be accomplished at the home
institutional laboratory.
We will conduct a full-day meeting (9am-5pm) before
the start of the next two conference meetings of the
Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (San
Francisco, CA and Tampa, FL, January 3rd, 2018 and
2019, respectively) with collaborative work among the re-
search groups during the interim period. The requested
funds will be used to reimburse the costs of travel to
each meeting (up to $300/meeting), SICB meeting regis-
tration, and one night of lodging (up to $200/meeting),
for all workshop participants per meeting. Workshop
participants will contribute to a nal report summa-
rizing our ndings that will be available through the
iDigBio website. We will also publish a multi-authored
paper based on the relative contributions of participants
towards data acquisition, NGS-based analyses, and the
review of lab-based protocols.
Prospective participants should have documented re-
search backgrounds in ONE or more of the following
categories: 1) NGS-based studies of polar organisms,
2) Methodologies for determining genes under positive
selection or showing evidence of convergent evolution
(PAML, HyPHy, Phytools, etc.), 3) Phylogenomics of
polar organisms, and 4) Physiological adaptations of
polar organisms.

1. Course content
This course aims at detailed understanding and hands-
on experience of using state of the art bioinformatics
pipelines for one\s own biological research questions. An
important aspect of the course is to show how genomic
data can be applied to address and answer research
questions in the elds of genetics, ecology, population
biology, biodiversity monitoring and conservation. The
students will be trained in the latest bioinformatic meth-
ods to analyze high throughput sequencing data, which
is present in many research projects. The course will
cover basic computing tools required to run command
line applications, processing high throughput sequencing
data of whole genome / exome / restriction site digested
(RAD) DNA for population genomic studies.
The rst part of the course introduces general computing
tools for beginners such as the UNIX command line envi-
ronment, bash commands, data formatting using regular
expressions and basic scripting in the unix shell with a
series of examples and exercises using a remote server.
The course introduces bioinformatics software for analy-
sis of RAD-data, and downstream population genetic
analysis of genotype data. The course also introduces
basic and advanced concepts of population genomics
data analysis such as genome/transcriptome assembly,
alignment/mapping, dierential Gene expression, func-
tional enrichment tests, SNP genotyping, PCA, outlier
tests. The course corresponds to 1 week of full time
studies and and is composed of lectures, demonstrations
and computer labs.
2. Outcomes
1. Knowledge and understanding 1a. Demonstrate
advanced knowledge of experimental strategies, applica-
tions and bioinformatic tools for population genomics.
1b. Demonstrate advanced knowledge of the poten-
tial of genomics approaches to answer ecosystem-widequestions, in particular for biodiversity monitoring.
2. Skills and abilities 2a. Ability to use basic commands
in the Unix command line environment (reformatting
data with regular expressions, basic scripting, running
python scripts from the unix shell)
2b. Ability to use dierent software tools to analyse
sequence data from restriction-site digested DNA (data
cleaning steps, clustering of reads, mapping to reference
genomes, extracting and ltering genotype data.
2c. Ability to use population genomics software tools
to assemble and a genome/transcriptome, and perform
gene alignment/mapping, dierential gene expression,
functional enrichment tests, SNP genotyping, PCA, out-

Introduction to Bioinformatics using LINUX
https://www.prinformatics.com/course/introduction-
to-bioinformatics-using-linux-ibul02/ Instructor: Dr.
Martin Jones
This course will run from 16th - 20th October at SCENE
(the Scottish Centre for Ecology and the Natural Envi-
ronment), Loch Lomond National Park, Glasgow.152 EvolDir October 1, 2017
Course overview: Most high-throughput bioinformatics
work these days takes place on the Linux command line.
The programs which do the majority of the computa-
tional heavy lifting ^ a egenome assemblers, read mappers,
and annotation tools ^ a eare designed to work best when
used with a command-line interface. Because the com-
mand line can be an intimidating environment, many
biologists learn the bare minimum needed to get their
analysis tools working. This means that they miss out
on the power of Linux to customize their environment
and automate many parts of the bioinformatics work-
ow. This course will introduce the Linux command
line environment from scratch and teach students how
to make the most of its tools to achieve a high level of
productivity when working with biological data.
Availability: 15 places total.
Course programme Monday 16th - Classes from 09:00
to 17:00 (approximately) Session 1 - The design of
Linux In the rst session we briey cover the design
of Linux: how is it dierent from Windows/OSX and
how is it best used? We'll then jump straight onto the
command line and learn about the layout of the Linux
lesystem and how to navigate it. We'll describe Linux's
le permission system (which often trips up beginners),
how paths work, and how we actually run programs on
the command line. We'll learn a few tricks for using the
command line more eciently, and how to deal with
programs that are misbehaving. We'll nish this session
by looking at the built in help system and how to read
and interpret manual pages.
Session 2 - System management We'll rst look at
a few command line tools for monitoring the status of
the system and keeping track of what's happening to
processor power, memory, and disk space. We'll go over
the process of installing new software from the built in
repositories (which is easy) and from source code down-
loads (which is trickier). We'll also introduce some tools
for benchmarking software (measuring the time/memory
requirements of processing large datasets).
Tuesday 17th - Classes from 09:00 to 17:00 (approxi-
mately)
Session 3 - Manipulating tabular data Many data
types we want to work with in bioinformatics are stored
as tabular plain text les, and here we learn all about
manipulating tabular data on the command line. We'll
start with simple things like extracting columns, lter-
ing and sorting, searching for text before moving on to
more complex tasks like searching for duplicated values,
summarizing large les, and combining simple tools into
long commands.
Session 4 - Constructing pipelines In this session wewill look at the various tools Linux has for constructing
pipelines out of individual commands. Aliases, shell
redirection, pipes, and shell scripting will all be intro-
duced here. We'll also look at a couple of specic tools
to help with running tools on multiple processors, and
for monitoring the progress of long running tasks.
Wednesday 18th - Classes from 09:00 to 17:00 (approxi-
mately)
Session 5 - EMBOSS EMBOSS is a suite of bioinfor-
matics command-line tools explicitly designed to work
in the Linux paradigm. We'll get an overview of the
dierent sequence data formats that we might expect to
work with, and put what we learned about shell script-
ing to biological use by building a pipeline to compare
codon usage across two collections of DNA sequences.
Session 6 - Using a Linux server Often in bioinfor-
matics we'll be working on a Linux server rather than
our own computer^ a etypically because we need access
to more computing power, or to specialized tools and
datasets. In this session we'll learn how to connect to
a Linux server and how to manage sessions. We'll also
consider the various ways of moving data to and from
a server from your own computer, and nish with a
discussion of the considerations we have to make when
working on a shared computer.
Thursday 19th - Classes from 09:00 to 17:00 (approxi-
mately)
Session 7 - Combining methods In the next two ses-
sions ^ a ei.e. one full day ^ a ewe'll put everything we have
learned together and implement a workow for next-
gen sequence analysis. In this rst session we'll carry
out quality control on some paired-end Illumina data
and map these reads to a reference genome. We'll then
look at various approaches to automating this pipeline,
allowing us to quickly do the same for a second dataset.

Geometric Morphometrics Using R (GMMR01)
https://www.prstatistics.com/course/geometric-
morphometrics-using-r-gmmr01/ This course is being
delivered by Prof. Dean Adams, Prof. Michael
Collyer and Dr. Antigoni Kaliontzopoulou | This
course will run from 19th - 23rd February 2018 at
Margam Discovery Centre, Wales, UK. | The eld
of geometric morphometrics (GM) is concerned with
the quantication and analysis of patterns of shape
variation, and its covariation with other variables. Over
the past several decades these approaches have become
a mainstay in the eld of ecology, evolutionary biology,
and anthropology, and a panoply of analytical tools for
addressing specic biological hypotheses concerning
shape have been developed. The goal of this is to
provide participants with a working knowledge of
the theory of geometric morphometrics, as well as
practical training in the application of these methods.
| The course is organized in both theoretical and
practical sessions. The theoretical sessions will provide
a comprehensive introduction to the methods of
landmark-based geometric morphometrics, which aims
at providing the participants with a solid theoretical
background for understanding the procedures used in
shape data analysis. Practical sessions will include
worked examples, giving the participants the oppor-
tunity to gain hands-on experience in the treatment
of shape data using the R package geomorph. These
sessions focus on the generation of shape variables from
primary landmark data, the statistical treatment of
shape variation with respect to biological hypotheses,
and the visualization of patterns of shape variation
and of the shapes themselves for interpretation of
statistical ndings, using the R language for statistical
programming. While practice datasets will be available,it is strongly recommended that participants come
with their own datasets. | Note: Because this is a
geometric morphometrics workshop in R, it is required
that participants have some working knowledge in
R. The practical sessions of the course will focus on
GM-based analyses, and not basic R user-interfacing.
It is therefore strongly recommended that participants
refresh their R skills prior to attending the workshop. |

\Structural Equation Modelling for Ecologists and Evo-
lutionary Biologists"
Delivered by Dr. Jarret Byrnes and Dr. Jon Lefcheck
www.prstatistics.com/course/structural-equation-
modelling-for-ecologists-and-evolutionary-biologists-
semr01/ This course will run from 23rd - 27th October
2017 at Margam Park Discovery Centre, Wales, UK
Course only and all inclusive packages are available.The course is a primer on structural equation modelling
(SEM) and conrmatory path analysis, with an em-
phasis on practical skills and applications to real-world
data.
Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) is a rapidly grow-
ing technique in ecology and evolution that unites multi-
ple hypotheses in a single causal network. It provides an
intuitive graphical representation of relationships among
variables, underpinned by well-described mathematical
estimation procedures. Several advances in SEM over
the past few years have expanded its utility for typical
ecological datasets, which include count data, missing
observations, and nested or hierarchical designs. We
will cover the basic philosophy behind SEM, provide
approachable mathematical explanations of the tech-
niques, and cover recent extensions to mixed eects
models and non-normal distributions. Along the way,
we will work through many examples from the primary
literature using the open- source statistical software
R (www.r-project.org). We will draw on two popular
R packages for conducting SEM, including lavaan and
piecewiseSEM. Participants are encouraged to bring
their own data, as there will be opportunities through-
out the course to plan, analyse, and receive feedback on
structural equation models.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.158 EvolDir October 1, 2017
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
