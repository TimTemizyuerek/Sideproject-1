WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION
Bioinformatics and statistical genetics, twin themes of
the long-running series of annual MASAMB meetings,
have gained huge impetus from large-scale genome se-
quencing projects and development of high-throughput
biological assay systems, including gene-expression mi-
croarrays, proteomic and single-cell genomics technolo-
gies. These immense data resources, and the underlying
complexities of molecular and cell biology, provide ex-
citing research opportunities for numerate scientists.
The workshop will host presentations of emerging prob-
lems and statistical techniques in molecular biology. |
We encourage contributions describing either progress on
new molecular problems or work on established problems
using new approaches that are substantially dierent
from established approaches. Kernel methods, graphical
models, semi-supervised approaches, feature selection
and other techniques applied to relevant problems would
all be appropriate for the workshop.|
SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
The MASAMB program will be compiled from submit-
ted abstracts. Researchers interested in contributing
should upload a one-page abstract in PDF format to
the MASAMB submission site|
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=masamb2016by August 5, 11:59pm (BST).
All submissions will be peer reviewed and will be evalu-
ated on the basis of their technical content. |A typical
submission to the workshop represents a new mathe-
matical or statistical approach applied to a problem in
molecular biology. We encourage submissions both for
established as well as new and emerging elds.
The workshop allows submissions of abstracts that are
based on papers that are currently under review or have
been recently published in a conference or a journal. The
authors should clearly state any overlapping published
work at time of submission.|

International Conference on Holobionts,
Paris (Natural History National Museum), April 19-21,
2017
It is becoming increasingly clear that the development,
nutrition, physiology and health of most organisms are
inuenced by the complex microbial communities they
host, hereby shaping their ecology and evolution. Biol-
ogy is indeed undergoing a paradigm shift, where indi-
vidual phenotypes are seen as a result of the combined
expression of the host and associated microbe genomes,
leading to the popularization of the holobiont concept
(the host and its microbiota) and the hologenome (the
collective genomes of a holobiont). Ecological and tech-
nical advances, especially in next generation sequencing
technologies, have greatly contributed to this conceptual
shift, thereby revealing the diversity and roles of the
microbes hosted by diverse organisms, from people and
plants, to sponges and insects. The scientic commu-
nity has now recognized that the host organisms cannot
be studied without taking resident microbiomes into
account, making holobiont research imperative across
numerous elds of the life and medical sciences.
The objective of the International Conference on Holo-
bionts, Paris 2017 is to, for the rst time, bring scientists
together who are interested in holobiont systems and
their study. This conference will highlight major ad-
vances in dening the key roles of host-borne microbiota
in the ecology and evolution of higher organisms and
the potential implications for human health, food pro-
duction and ecosystem functioning. In addition, the
conference will oer a platform for debate related to
the denition, assembly and evolution of holobionts. By
bringing a range of holobiont researchers together, the
International Conference on Holobionts seeks to help
consolidate the eld, facilitate exchange of knowledge
across systems and approaches and stimulate further
developments in this emerging discipline.
Scientic program. This conference will address the
following topics:
1. Holobionts and evolution
2. Emerging approaches to holobiont research
3. Microbiota and host health
4. Mechanisms for holobiont assemblyAugust 1, 2016 EvolDir 5
5. Metabolic interactions between host and microbiota
For each topic, we encourage oral and poster communi-
cations on holobiont systems from dierent perspectives
including theoretical, empirical, fundamental and ap-
plied researches.

18th YOUNG SYSTEMATISTS' FORUM
Friday, 25 November 2016, 9:30 am Venue: Flett Lecture
Theatre, Natural History Museum, London, UK
The annual Young Systematists' Forum represents an
exciting setting for Masters, PhD and young postdoc-
toral researchers to present their data, often for the rst
time, to a scientic audience interested in taxonomy,
systematics and phylogenetics. This well-established
event provides an important opportunity for budding
systematists to discuss their research in front of their
peers within a supportive environment. Supervisors and
other established systematists are also encouraged to
attend.
Prizes will be awarded for the most promising oral and
poster presentation as judged by a small panel on the
day.
Registration is FREE. Send applications by e-mail to
(YSF.SystematicsAssociation@gmail.com), supplying
your name, contact address and stating whether or
not you wish to give an oral or poster presentation.
Please also tell us your academic stage - e.g., Masters,
PhD or postdoc. Space will be allocated subject to
availability and for a balanced programme of animal,
plant, algal, microbial, molecular and other research.
Non-presenting attendees are also very welcome - please
register as above.
Again the YSF will be held the day after
the Molluscan Forum (http://www.malacsoc.org.uk/-
MolluscanForum.htm) also at the Natural History Mu-
seum. This has been arranged so both meetings can be
attended, although if attending both you will have to
register for both meetings separately.
Abstracts must be submitted by e-mail in English no
later than Friday 28 October 2016. The body text
should not exceed 150 words in length. Title, authors,
and their professional aliations should be included
with the abstracts. If the presentation is co-authored,
the actual speaker (oral) or presenter (poster) must be
clearly indicated in BOLD text.
If you have presented a talk at the YSF before, we
ask that you submit only for a poster presentation, as
speaker slots are limited and we want to give as many6 EvolDir August 1, 2016
people a chance as possible. Similarly, if you are pre-
senting at both the YSF and MF, we ask that you not
apply for speaking slots in both (or let us know so we
can assess).
All registered attendants will receive further informa-
tion about the meeting, including abstracts, by e-
mail one week in advance. This information will also
be displayed on the Systematics Association website
(www.systass.org).

We are proud to build on the success of previous
ISBA conferences held in Amsterdam, Stockholm, York,
Copenhagen, Beijing, and most recently Basel in 2014,
however we are very much looking forward to being able
to welcome you to our city and to our University. Nine
centuries of development have gone into building the
University of Oxford and its colleges and we are fortu-
nate to be able to hosting ISBA7 in two of the nest
University and college settings; the day sessions willtake place at the Oxford Museum of Natural History
(http://www.oum.ox.ac.uk/) and the conference will
conclude on the Friday evening with a drinks reception
and banquet in the spectacular dining hall at Balliol
college http://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/) one of the oldest
Oxford colleges.
Getting to Oxford could not be easier. We are at the
heart of the UK and fast and ecient train and coach
services link Oxford with London and the north and
south of the country, and the M40 and A34 ensure easy
access by road.
Please forward information about ISBA7 onto any-
one who might be interested and let us know if
you have any queries by emailing the organizers at
isba7@arch.ox.ac.uk
We look forward to welcoming you in September!

Dear all,
The registration for the PAG meeting is open: In-
ternational Plant & Animal Genome XXV - http:/-
/www.intlpag.org/ - January 14-18, 2017 - San Diego,
CA, USA
This meeting is among the largest for non-human
genomics globally (thousands of attendants; including a
genomics technology fair). Much of it is about plant
and animal breeding but over the last few years there is
a growing community of Ecology and Evolution sessions
with hundreds of attendants across sessions. Last year
we successfully hosted a session about non-model avian
genomics (\Avian Genomics - Going Wild!") which
was well perceived. Please have a look at the speakers
and topics of #PAGXXIV: https://pag.confex.com/-
pag/xxiv/meetingapp.cgi/Session/3531. And here for
reference the overall workshop list of #PAGXXIV:
https://pag.confex.com/pag/xxiv/meetingapp.cgi/-
Program/1051 . The conference starts on Saturday,
14th January. On the Friday 13th we will do a
pre-conference birding tour around San Diego for
everyone who is interested (not only the speakers!!).
If you are at PAG and can't give a talk, please be in
touch about the birding tour nonetheless.
In our Avian Genomics workshop we seek to present cur-
rent states of *omics in ecology and evolution of birds,
as broadly as possible. I herewith invite contributions
from the community for giving a talk. Please send your
abstract of 200-300 words to me until 27th August.
Feel free to forward to approach me with questions.
Very best regards, Robert Kraus

Symposium: Investigating ecological and evolutionary
processes with NGSAugust 1, 2016 EvolDir 9
Global change drivers create new environmental scenar-
ios and selective pressures, aecting animal and plant
species in various interacting ways. Understanding how
the genome of an organism evolves and copes with envi-
ronmental challenges is the main goal of Ecological and
Evolutionary Genomics (EEG). EEG involves the inte-
gration of genomic data to the phenotype and ecosys-
tem function of the organism. The development of
next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies oers
an unprecedented opportunity to understand the genetic
architecture of fundamental ecological and evolutionary
processes such as migration, foraging behavior, energet-
ics, and communication in natural populations as well
as to identify the environmental factors that drive local
adaptation. The aim of this symposium is to discuss the
promise of NGS technologies in order to study ecological
adaptation and bring together eld biologists along the
molecular to theoretical continuum to exchange ideas
and perspectives.
Invited speaker, Aaron Schafer (Trent University),
Canada: \Using genomic data to infer demographic
and adaptive processes in natural populations".
The online abstracts submission for the symposium is
open until the 5th of September. This symposium is
part of the XIV MEDECOS & XIII AEET meeting,
which will take place in Seville, Spain, from January 31
to February 4, 2017.

Swedish Museum of Natural History, Stockholm, Sweden
Scandinavia was covered by a large ice sheet during thelast glacial maximum, which means most modern-day
animals, plants and humans have a recent origin in the
region. But their origins and subsequent history have
until recently remained unresolved.
The Swedish Museum of Natural History invites you
to a symposium where some of the world's leading
researchers in genetics, paleobiology and archaeology
present the latest research results on the origins and
natural history of the Scandinavian biota.

Tuscany Speciation Feb19-24
Registration
We are pleased to announce SPECIATION 2017, a Gor-
don Research Conference (GRC) dedicated exclusively
to speciation research. The conference | the world's
largest of its kind | will be held at the Renaissance
Tuscany Il Ciocco Resort & Spa in Italy during the
week of February 19-24, 2017. Invited presentations and
discussion sessions will cover a broad array of timely
topics in speciation research. A preliminary program
for the GRC is now posted.
The conference will be directly preceded by a two-
day Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), co-chaired by
Amanda Hund and Laurel Symes, that oers opportu-
nities for early-career scientists to get involved at the
forefronts of modern speciation research. Participants
will engage in scientic discussions on salient topics of
interest, thereby gaining knowledge and condence for
their participation in SPECIATION 2017.
The GRC conferences on speciation raise to a trans-Atlantic level a tradition of international conferences on
speciation research that was initiated by the European
Research Networking Programme 'Frontiers of Speci-
ation Research'. The three conferences held thus far,
in 2010, 2013, and 2015, have helped facilitate bridge-
building between disparate approaches to speciation
research and have attracted hundreds of participants
from all facets of speciation research.
Registration for SPECIATION 2017 is open at https://-
www.grc.org/programs.aspx?id=16903 and will continue
until the venue's capacity is lled.

INVITATION to the Hierarchy Group Workshop and
launch of the book \Evolutionary Theory: A Hierarchi-
cal Perspective"
A symposium centered around the upcoming publication
of the multi-authored book,
EVOLUTIONARY THEORY: A HIERARCHICAL
PERSPECTIVE (N. Eldredge, T. Pievani, E. Serrelli
and I. T emkin, eds.), Chicago University Press (Septem-
ber 2016; http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/-
chicago/E/bo25468890.html),
will be held at the National Academy of Science (NAS,Washington, DC) on September 22 (Thursday) 2016,
2:30-5:00 PM.
The day after, September 23, the Northern Virginia
Community College (NOVA; Annandale, VA) will host
a series of workshops with the contributing authors of
the book and several discussants to discuss issues re-
lated to the hierarchy theory in biology in an informal
atmosphere, and to foster further collaborative work.
Beside the workshops at NOVA, an hour-long public
event promoting the book is scheduled for the middle of
the day at NOVA, a more abbreviated and less formal
version of the NAS symposium.
More detailed information and tentative schedules of
the events are available on the Hierarchy Group website
(www.hierarchygroup.com), where you also nd further
information on the hierarchy theory of evolution.
We extend our invitation to students, scholars, re-
searchers, and educators interested in evolution to at-
tend both events and contribute to the discussions. As
the number of attendees is limited, we kindly ask you
to contact us at grouphierarchy@gmail.com to reserve
your seat in advance.
We look forward to seeing you in September.
Respectfully,
Andrea Parravicini, Ph.D. & Ilya T emkin, Ph.D. on
behalf of the Editorial team, Evolutionary Theory: A

The origin of odorant receptors in insects
A PhD position is available to study the origins of a
unique family of receptors for odorants and pheromones
that arose early in the evolution of insects. Supported
from a grant from the prestigious Marsden Fund, the
PhD project will address the timing and role of the rst
insect odorant receptors. Our hypothesis is that they
appeared just before the origin of insect ight and ex-
panded to ll roles in detecting food, predators and/or
mates in this new three dimensional environment. The
research will involve the isolation of candidate odorant
receptors from the transcriptomes and genomes of early
insects and their deorphaning in surrogate cell systems.

area of research in the Institute:
Project Title: Identication of chemical signals which
modulate oviposition behaviour of the disease vector
Aedes aegypti in urban environments
Project Description: The mosquito Aedes aegytpi trans-
mits the etiologic agents of serious viral diseases, in-
cluding Dengue and Zika, across South America. These
viruses are passed from human to human through the
blood-feeding behaviour of female A. aegypti. Protein
from the blood is required for A. aegypti to produce eggs,
which in urban environments are laid in small pools of
water close to human habitation. Finding and elimi-
nating oviposition sites is the major focus of Dengue
and Zika control strategies in Brazil, with water tanks,
discarded containers and plant pots all frequently en-
countered as containing larvae and pupae. Egg-laying A.
aegypti are attracted to odours derived from infusions of
plant material, which in natural habitats may indicate
a suitable egg laying site containing bacteria on which
larvae can feed. However, the extent to which analogous
chemical cues are used to locate and choose oviposition
sites in urban environments is not yet known. This in-
formation is essential to predicting where breeding sites
are most likely to occur, and to develop new methods
of attracting A. aegypti to oviposition traps, and away
from people.
The work will comprise both chemical analysis and be-
havioural elements, using water odour samples and A.
aegypti which have been collected from Brazil. It will
build on the framework set out by the collaborative
MRC-Newton grant awarded to Dr R. Hopkins at NRI
and our collaborators at Instituto Oswaldo Cruz in
Brazil. There is the possibility to conduct some of the
work in Brazil, to demonstrate the potential impact of
the results in a eld setting.

sity and the processes that explain its heterogeneous
distribution across multiple scales.
Topics:
- You will employ novel analytical tools being developed
in the group to disentangle the importance of species'
total and relative abundances, as well as spatial aggre-
gations, in driving the species-energy relationship.
- There will be three facets to this PhD project: (i) a
meta-analysis of the species-energy relationship derived
from the published literature, (ii) analyses of global ter-restrial and aquatic databases where species-energy data
can be derived, (iii) eld collected data on the species-
energy relationship in grassland plots distributed in
multiple locations across the world.
- You will be integrated in our research group composed
of international experts who can transmit their exper-
tise, and in close proximity to experts of adjacent elds,
providing opportunities for interdisciplinary collabora-
tion. In addition, you will integrate the yDiv doctoral
program which oers courses and activities for a suc-
cessful dissertation and be prepared for the rest of your
career while having the recognition of an excellent track.
Requirements /expected prole:
- Masters degree (MSc) (or one that will be delivered by
July) in a relevant eld and excellent records.
- Fluent in English with excellent communication skills.
- We are looking for a motivated researcher interested
in how biodiversity varies with increasing energy inputs
(i.e., the species-energy relationship), which is one of
the most important environmental gradients structuring
biodiversity on the planet.
Postdoctoral associates will develop collaborations with
Professor Chase and other members of the iDiv commu-
nity that complement and extend the overall aim of the
working group, including (but not limited to) extending
these approaches to include temporal aspects of biodi-
versity change through time, responses of phylogenetic
and functional diversity (and beta-diversity), microbial
communities, and theoretical approaches that examine
biodiversity patterns and processes in space and time.
In addition, postdocs will have the opportunity to col-
laborate with working groups of visiting international
researchers through the associated Synthesis of Cen-
tre for Biodiversity Sciences (sDiv), to participate in
the training of master's and PhD students through the
Young Biodiversity Research Training group (yDiv) and

School of Natural Sciences and Psychology at Liverpool
John Moores University:
Title:\Epigenetic inheritance of ecological information"
Description:Organisms are thought to adapt to changing
environments through either short term (e.g. phenotypic
plasticity) or long term processes (e.g. genetic muta-
tion & evolution, gene ow). Accumulating evidence,
primarily from rodents, suggests that there is an addi-
tional mechanism, epigenetic inheritance, which facili-
tates adaption to challenges over the medium term. How-
ever disentangling epigenetic inheritance from maternal
eects is problematic in mammals due to viviparity: in-
ternal fertilisation and development permit the mother
to exert considerable inuence on ospring phenotype
during embryonic development, potentially masking di-
rect epigenetic inheritance. This project will investigate
the role of epigenetic inheritance in vertebrates using the
classical genetic model organism the zebrash (Danio re-
rio). As an externally-fertilising species with no parental
care, zebrash are an ideal, genetically tractable model
organism in which to study the mechanisms of epigenetic
inheritance while controlling other transgenerational in-
uences such as maternal eects.
Thisproject will involve manipulation of the parental
environment to identify experiences and ecological chal-
lenges which produce transgenerational behavioural
or physiological eects. Following characterisation of
parental and ospring phenotypes, RNAseq will be used
to identify dierentially expressed genes associated with
dierent phenotypes in ospring. Associated changes in
epigenetic status of DNA and chromatin will be charac-August 1, 2016 EvolDir 17
terised to investigate the epigenetic mechanisms involved
in the observed transgenerational eects.
Theproject will involve both molecular biology and
bioinformatics as well as behavioural and physiological
analysis and would suit a student with either a genet-
ics/molecular biology background and a keen interest in
whole animal biology, or a zoology/organismal biology
background and strong molecular biology knowledge
and skills. The project will be supervised by Dr Will
Swaney, Dr Craig Wilding and Dr Prim Singh, all at
LJMU.

Rosco France
MarineParasiteEvolution
Open PhD position at Rosco (France)
http://www.sb-rosco.fr/en The paradox of being a
specialist for a parasite of marine blooming dinoagel-
lates
The parasitism is a frequent lifestyle in nature and a
major source of evolutionary pressure for both the host
and the parasite. Given the ubiquity of host-parasite
interactions, understanding the factors that generate,
maintain, and constrain these associations is of primary
interest with implications for a wide range of ecolog-
ical issues, including dynamics of emerging infectious
diseases and invasions (Daszak et al. 2000, Keane and
Crawley 2002). Although little studied, many extremely
virulent microeukaryotic parasites infecting microalgae
have been detected in the marine plankton. Among
them are Syndiniales, which constitute a diverse and
highly widespread group (Guillou et al. 2008). Because
of their virulence and abundant ospring, such parasites
have the potential to control dinoagellate populations,
and therefore toxic microalgal blooms (Alves de Souza et
al. 2015). These parasites usually exhibit a narrow host
spectrum (Chambouvet et al. 2008). Such specializa-
tion strongly relies on the life-history traits and ecology
of the host. However, coastal planktonic ecosystems
are by nature characterized by strong environmental
uctuations and rapid turnovers, even at the population
level (Dia et al. 2014). Considering the short generation
time and the high dispersal capacity of microalgae, their
parasites must adapt at a signicantly faster rate than
for larger hosts (e.g. plants or animals). All of these
considerations should theoretically lead to the natural
selection of generalist parasites at the expense of special-
ists. The persistence and ecological success of specialists
among marine planktonic parasites is thus an intriguing
paradox.
We hypothesise that host specialization is constrained
by evolutionary processes underlying key steps duringthe infection (such as penetration inside the host and the
takeover of the host). We will explore this hypothesis
at the cellular level, using molecular approaches
Strategy
We will screened intra and inter variability of >70
parasitic strains corresponding to 7 genetic clusters
(based on their ITS). All of these parasites belong to the
same genus (Amoebophrya, Syndiniales) and infect di-
noagellates, but have dierent host range. NGS reads
(RAD and/or MIG-seq) will be mapped on two complete
genomes recently acquired from two strains having con-
trasting host range (one specialist and one able to infect
several species and at least two genera), and for which a
model of gene prediction is available (using transcripts
acquired every 6 hours during a complete life cycle).
Genes under positive selection will be screened with the
hypothesis that such genes could be involved in speci-
ation, host-parasite interactions, or sex determination.
Special attention will be given to homologues with a
known function nd in other dinoagellates and closely
related parasites such as Apicomplexa (e.g. Plasmodium
falciparum) and Perkinsozoa. Novel hypotheses will be
then tested in the laboratory using living strains. The
PhD student will also actively participate in the expert
annotation of genomes, being fully integrated to the
international consortium.
Skills
- Strong background in Microbiology
- Knowledge of NGS analysis tools and methods
- Knowledge in population genetics and/or molecular
biology
- Ability to work and integrate a team
- Autonomy, rigor and openness
Applications should be sent to Laure Guillou
(lguillou@sb-rosco.fr).
Context of the project:
This project is part of the ANR HAPAR (Head L. Guil-
lou), in collaboration with the ABiMS platform (Analy-
sis and Bioinformatics for Marine Science) at the Station
Biologique of Rosco (France), the University of Ghent
(Belgium, S. Rombauts, Y. Van de Peer), and the Geno-

on our 35,000+ repository of wolf, coyote, fox, lynx and
bobcat fur and tissue samples, we aim to determine how
carnivore stress levels, diet breadth, and genetics vary ac-
cording to environmental factors like climate, habitat, or
anthropogenic activity. There is further opportunity to
investigate processes underlying spatio-temporal varia-
tion in patterns of dispersal and population connectivity,
and the contribution of environmental variability and
intrinsic features of the individual animal to such pro-
cesses. Of particular interest is the role of climate changeon stress levels and diet breadth, as well as potential
variation in functional genes especially in environments
undergoing rapid change. Our recent work (mostly on
lynx and coyotes) sets the foundation for this work,
and our next challenge is to develop a more compre-

linkages across carnivore species and through space and
time. Our team has access to abundant samples and
state-of-the-art analytical facilities and equipment to
address these research questions, and the successful
candidate will have the opportunity to develop his/her
own research interests within the scope of the broader

PHD OPPORTUNITY IN ECO-EVOLUTIONARY DY-
NAMICS AND DISEASE EVOLUTION IN MODERN
HUMANS
Population Genetics Lab ^A' prof. Emmanuel Milot,
Universite of Quebec at Trois-Rivi eres
Send your application by August 12th 2016
A PhD candidate is sought to work on evolution in con-
temporary human populations. The aims of the project
are 1) to measure selection on genetic variation shaping
life history and diseases (e.g. asthma, neuropathy); 2)
to assess how eco-evolutionary dynamics modulate this
variation within the context of modernization (main col-
laborators: Simon Gravel, McGill University; Catherine
Laprise, Universite of Quebec at Chicoutimi). While itis sometimes claimed that humans have stopped evolv-
ing, recent studies suggest that selection on heritable
traits, thus the potential for evolution, is ubiquitous in
our species. Moreover, abrupt changes that have oc-
curred over the last centuries, such as the demographic
transition, have profoundly modied the playground of
natural selection. These processes may have important
consequences on reproduction, health and ageing and
could also be modulated by eco-evolutionary feedbacks
between demography and genetic changes in traits.
The successful applicant will study the process of selec-
tion and genetic change generation-by-generation, using
exceptional human data (pedigree and genome scans)
from the Qu ebec population since its foundation, which
has become a model recognized worldwide in population
genetics. He/she will join an interuniversity team in
evolutionary biology that will provide opportunities to
interact and collaborate with researchers from various
disciplines (ecology, evolutionary ecology, epidemiology,
anthropology, demography, medicine, etc.).
FUNDING AND CONDITION FOR ADMISSION The
project is funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineer-
ing Council of Canada (NSERC) and the Qu ebec Nature
and Technologies Research Fund (FRQNT). We seek
candidates with proles good enough to apply for schol-
arships. Candidates must have undergraduate (bache-
lor^A1s) and Master degrees in biology or bioinformatics
or in a related domain, or expect to have completed their
degree very soon. Proles with a strong background in
bioinformatics or statistics will be preferred.

UTulsa EvolutionaryBiol
Department of Biological Sciences - University of Tulsa
The Booth lab at The University of Tulsa is currently
seeking M.Sc and Ph.D students. Four projects are
available:
1) Identifying the genomic signatures of host-associated
dierentiation. Through genome resequencing of 22
lines of haematophagous insect and the availability of
two annotated reference genomes, we seek to understandgenes driving dierentiation to alternative mammalian
hosts. This project will be primarily bioinformatic as
the genome resequencing has taken place. This may also
include transcriptomic and microbiomic components.
2) Spatiotemporal metapopulation dynamics and host-
species expansion of a disease-vectoring avian ectopar-
asite. Using both nuclear and mitochondrial markers,
we aim to understand variation in the temporal and
spatial structure of an avian ectoparasite undergoing
both a population range expansion and a host-species
expansion. This project has the potential to include
both genomic and microbiomic aspects also.
3) Understanding the dynamics of rapid and pervasive
mitochondrial heteroplasmy and recombination. Using a
mitogenomic approach this project seeks to 1) assess the
inuence of mitogenomic divergence on the frequency
of paternal leakage driven heteroplasmy; 2) to empir-
ically and theoretically evaluate heteroplasmy decay;
and 3) determine whether recombination hotspots can
be detected within the mitochondrial genome.
4) A genomic assessment of facultative parthenogene-
sis in snakes. We have generated RAD-Seq data for
parthenogens, their mothers, and in one case, their o-
spring. Using this data, and two published genomes, we
seek to address two main questions. 1) Can we identify
the automictic mechanism underlying the production
of parthenogens? This may be either terminal fusion
or gametic duplication; and 2) what are the genomic
characteristics of parthenogenesis and also sexual repro-
duction by facultative parthenogens, and can these be
detected in wild populations?
Applicants for this position should have a strong
background in population genetics/genomics, molec-
ular ecology, bioinformatics, or evolutionary bi-
ology, and meet the admission requirements for
the Department of Biological Sciences graduate
program. (https://graduate.utulsa.edu/admission/-
eligibility-requirements/). If a non-U.S citizen, the ap-
plicant must already have a valid VISA permitting them
to enter and study in the United States. Funds are not
currently available to cover this as part of this project.
The students stipend, tuition, and medical insurance, is
covered as part of the teaching assistantship (requires
20 hours per week teaching assistance).
Applications should include the following:
1) A letter of interest (not exceeding two pages).
2) A curriculum vitae.
3) Names and email addresses for at least two aca-
demics/researchers willing to provide a letter of recom-
mendationAugust 1, 2016 EvolDir 29

Hi, all
There will be one 3-year fully-funded PhD position avail-
able in the research group of Dr. Qi Zhou in the De-
partment of Molecular Evolution and Development. My
research is at the interface of evolution, epigenetics and
development. We harness the latest sequencing technolo-
gies and genomic tools to address basic questions about
how sex chromosomes evolve in Drosophila and birds.
Candidates are expected to have a Master degree in
Molecular Biology, Developmental Biology or Evolution.
Research experience in Drosophila genetics, specically
with skills of CRISPR/Cas9, transgenics or uorescence
in situ hybridization is highly preferred. The project
is going to use a recently evolved Drosophila young
sex chromosome system to study how euchromatin and
heterochromatin transit to each other on the sex chromo-
somes, and what are the role of small RNAs during this
process. I invite the interested candidates to directly
submit her/his CV, at least two recommendation letters,
and a one-page research statement to muntjaczhou at
gmail.com. I will interview the candidates until the
position is lled.More about my research can be refereed to

UZurich DolphinGenomes
Project title:
Unraveling the genetic architecture of dolphin genomes
using new sequence technologies and bioinformatics, and
application of genomic data to populations
Project description:
Innovations in sequence technology and computational
methods have prompted a shift towards individual
bioinformatics-savvy laboratories being able to accu-
rately assemble large and complex genomes. These devel-
opments make it feasible to generate detailed evolution-
ary analyses for non-model organisms. In this project,
we will sequence and assemble a reference genome of the
Indo-Pacic bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) with
a new protocol that gives long-range genetic informa-
tion. We will then re-sequence relevant subpopulations
to infer the demographic history and assess speciation
patterns in the genus Tursiops. Among marine mam-
mals, bottlenose dolphins are a tting candidate to
explore, given the detailed knowledge on their biology,
high levels of adaption, global distribution, and their
many convergent features with humans and great apes.
Comment:
This 4 year PhD position is based in the
Robinson (http://goo.gl/d9V7ci) and Krutzen
(http://goo.gl/tojCR1) labs at the University of Zurich
and will be embedded in the Zurich Life Science
Graduate School's program in Evolutionary Biology
(http://www.lifescience-graduateschool.ch/). Remuner-
ation is according to Swiss PhD salary scales (CHF
48'540 p.a. plus employer social security contributions).
Expected start date will be 1 January 2017.
We are seeking a highly collaborative, motivated and
dynamic student with a Bachelors or Masters degree
in Evolutionary Biology. The student possesses a good

Project title: Understanding invasions - from the genetic
basis to the ecological dynamics of spreading populations
Biological invasions are among the biggest threats to
natural ecosystems. Unfortunately, the causes of inva-
sions remain elusive, due to the large spatiotemporal
scales involved and the poor integration of macroecol-
ogy and evolutionary biology. Additionally, we lack
an integration of ecological and evolutionary theory
with experimental data. In this project the doctoral
researcher will conduct laboratory invasion experiments,
using the model organism /Tetrahymena thermophila/
in miniaturized landscapes suitable to study macroe-August 1, 2016 EvolDir 31
cological and evolutionary dynamics (Giometto et al.
2014 PNAS, Altermatt et al. 2015 Methods Ecol. Evol.,
Fronhofer & Altermatt 2015 Nature Comm.), in order
to track and understand the resulting eco-evolutionary
dynamics from genes to populations. During these in-
vasions, /Tetrahymena/ undergoes evolutionary adap-
tations that alter its ability to invade which aects the
ecological invasion dynamics. Whole genome sequencing
and computational analyses of sequence data will reveal
the genomic basis of observable phenotypic changes of
invading organisms. The experimental ndings will be
integrated into a consistent theoretical eco-evolutionary
framework using mathematical models and agent-based
simulations. This interdisciplinary and synthetic project
will promote our causal understanding of invasions and
range dynamics.
Competitive applicants will have previous experience
or a strong interest in evolutionary ecology, molecular
ecology or evolutionary biology. They ideally have sub-
stantial programming skills and optimally experience
in analyzing high-throughput sequence data. Excellent
experimental skills are a wanted. A background in mod-
eling is a plus. Candidates will be highly motivated,
enthusiastic and independent persons with a passion for
science. Excellent communication and writing skills in
English, good work ethics, and creative thinking are de-
sired. A Masters level degree (or equivalent) is necessary
for admission. The working language is English.
The project will be co-supervised by Prof. Dr. Florian
Altermatt, Prof. Dr. Andreas Wagner and Dr. Emanuel
Fronhofer. The project will be based at University of
Zurich and at Eawag. Zurich oers a stimulating and
international research environment, excellent research
facilities and a lively and social working place. The po-
sition will be for a period of four years, and should start
in January 2017 or soon thereafter. The PhD student
will be enrolled at University of Zurich and be part of

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT
Director of the Loro Parque Fundaci on
The organisation
The Loro Parque Fundaci on (LPF) is a private foun-
dation, created in 1994 and legally registered in Spain
as a charitable-status entity. It is a conservation NGO,
and member of the International Union for the Con-
servation of Nature - IUCN. Its HQ is located at Loro
Parque in Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain. Although
it has no national or regional branches, it operates at
international level and is represented in many countries
through its project partnerships with organisations in
those countries.
Its recent average annual spend directly on projects, of
which there are 36 active in 2016, is US $1 million. It
is the owner of, and manages the world's largest, most
diverse collection of Psittaciformes. The collection is a
genetic reserve and resource for research and exhibition
for education, as well as generating part of the income
of the LPF. The private company Loro Parque is its
principal sponsor, covering all operating costs so that
100% of all other donations go directly to the projects.
The larger proportion of projects is for the conservation
of threatened species of parrots, each project including
to a lesser or greater extent the direct protection of the
target species, the protection and restoration of habi-
tat, and the cooperation with and integration of the
local community into the conservation eort. The LPF
has increasing involvement in projects related to the
conservation of the marine environment, in particular
with whales and dolphins. More recently, the LPF is in-
volved in the conservation of large terrestrial mammals
in central southern Africa.
The LPF has a Board of Trustees (President, Secretary
and Vocals) which has ultimate responsibility for its
governance. An international advisory board meets an-
nually with the trustees and principal sta to review
progress and make recommendations about project sup-
port. There are also honorary vice-presidents.

managing the LPF project portfolio, with particular
emphasis on the terrestrial projects, and to provide suit-
able content for external communication of projects and
activities. The Director will represent the LPF in the

ership and research group management.
Students in this FIRE stream will investigate how small
genetic changes can profoundly inuence the develop-
ment and evolution of an extraordinary novel trait. They
will use a group of ies from Southeast Asia that exhibit
extreme sexual dimorphism in head shape with eyes on
the ends of stalks. In males, these eyestalks can each
exceed the length of the body. These ies provide a
tractable laboratory model for understanding how or-
ganism shape can evolve rapidly and dramatically as
a consequence of competition among males for mates.
Using data available for these ies and other organisms,
these studies will reveal how both highly conserved genes
and newly evolved genes contribute to the developmentAugust 1, 2016 EvolDir 47
of a novel trait. Students in this stream will gain a com-
prehensive understanding of how traits evolve and will
complete all aspects of the experiment, from dissecting
tissue, selecting genes to study, quantifying gene expres-
sion, analyzing data using statistical methods, and int
erpreting results.

dergraduate peer mentors through clear communication
and management. Ability to develop instructional cur-
riculum and protocols for research-based inquiry and
discipline understanding. Ability to eectively teach
undergraduate students in lecture and research-based
environments.
Ability to mentor students from research, academic and
personal perspectives. Ability to assess student learn-
ing through development of formative and summative
assessments appropriate for inquiry-based instruction.

with stream faculty members, undergraduate peer men-
tors, students and institutional colleagues. Ability to
problem-solve, prioritize and manage multiple projects
and timelines. Strong organizational and interpersonal
skills including the ability to communicate clearly and
eectively. Ability to work autonomously and collabo-
ratively.
Ability to coordinate multi-author publication develop-
ment and submission. Ability to communicate stream
and program accomplishment through presentation at
relevant conferences. Ability to serve the FIRE program
through oversight of some programmatic component
(peer mentor oversight, outreach, marketing, assessment,
etc). Flexibility to grow, adapt and change as FIRE
develops at UMD.

The Agents, Interaction and Complexity (AIC) group
within Electronics and Computer Science, at the Uni-
versity of Southampton, welcomes applications for a full
time post at either Lecturer or Associate Professor level.
Electronics and Computer Science (ECS) is the largest
and most distinguished School of its kind in the UK,
with a worldwide reputation for its research,enterprise
and research-lead teaching.
The AIC group undertakes world-leading, interdisci-
plinary research into the science and engineering of
computing systems, in particular those that connect
people and technology. We are interested in complex
socio-technical, socio-economic and socio-ecological sys-
tems that underpin the most pressing challenges cur-
rently facing society. Problems as diverse as engineering
resilient and sustainable smart infrastructure, or refac-
toring health-care systems to cope with demographic
change, understanding voting patterns, or anticipat-
ing and mitigating the impacts of climate change, all
involve building and analysing complex systems compris-
ing many interacting agents, including people and otherorganisms, hardware robots and autonomous software
agents.
AIC is a highly interdisciplinary group, not only col-
laborating across areas in Electronics and Computer
Science, but across disciplines from physics and maths
to psychology and the humanities. We are therefore
actively seeking colleagues with excellent research track
records and demonstrated ability to build collaborations,
especially across disciplinary boundaries, and to engage
in and to lead exciting, innovative work.
Applications are welcome in any of the group's key areas
of interaction, complexity and agent-based systems as
well as other areas that support the research themes and
ongoing projects in the group. Information analytics
and visualisation, serious games/play, machine learning
are examples of areas of particular additional interest.

LGBTQ survey
The Queer in STEM study of the career experiences of
lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, and other queer-identied
individuals working in science is now soliciting responses
for a new survey of science professionals ~A^A euro \ both
LGBTQ and "straight.\ Volunteers can take the sur-
vey immediately at http://bit.ly/queerstem2 ~A^A euro
"see below or http://www.queerstem.org for more in-
formation. EvolDir was a big help with participant
recruitment for our previous survey, and my collabora-
tors and I would be very grateful for your participation
in this new project, and assistance in passing the survey
link along to folks who should participate.
Thanks! Jeremy Yoder
Postdoctoral Research Fellow Forest and Conserva-
tion Sciences University of British Columbia jbyo-
der@gmail.com http://jbyoder.org Introducing Queer
in STEM 2.0
Three years ago, we launched Queer in STEM (http://-
www.queerstem.org) to take the rst in-depth look at
the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, or queer-
identied (LGBTQ) professionals working in science,
technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) elds.
This summer, we're excited to announce a new chapter
of the project: Queer in STEM 2.0.
The original Queer in STEM study
More than 1,400 people from across the U.S., Canada,
and around the world answered the original Queer in
STEM online survey, and 120 volunteered to answer in-
depth follow-up questions. The results of that original
online survey have now recieved substantial news cover-
age, and been reported in many seminar presentations,
an upcoming book chapter, and a peer-reviewed research
article (PDF available at https://drive.google.com/-
le/d/0B8WTovkBDKYWUUd1RnRXTmRkTU0/-
view?usp=sharing). We found that
- LGBTQ-identied people work in STEM elds from
evolutionary biology to particle physics; - More than
40% have not disclosed their LGBTQ identity to col-
leagues, coworkers, or students, even if they are totally
out of the closet at home; - LGBTQ-identied people are
more likely to be open about their identities if they know
their colleagues and employers support them, and if they
work in STEM elds with more even representation of
men and women.Queer in STEM 2.0: New questions, new approach, new
discoveries
As in all scientic projects, these discoveries lead to
more questions. Do LGBTQ-identied people remain
in the closet in STEM workplaces mainly because they
feel a lack of support, or because STEM workplace cul-
tures discourage discussion of personal lives outside the
lab? How do LGBTQ-identied colleagues, mentors,
and role models aect their careers? Does being out in
the workplace aect their research productivity?
Queer in STEM 2.0 aims to answer these questions
with a new online survey designed for more specic
hypothesis testing. We hope to hear again from partic-
ipants in the original Queer in STEM survey, and to
achieve an even bigger sample from LGBTQ-identied
STEM professionals across the U.S. and Canada. Fi-
nally, in our biggest innovation from the original study,
we will also ask STEM professionals who don't identify
as LGBTQ to answer many of the same questions we
will ask LGBTQ-identied participants, to provide a
powerful new tool for understanding the survey results:
a control sample.
Queer in STEM 2.0 ocially launched on June 20,
2016, and is now open for responses at http://bit.ly/-
queerstem2. We are asking LGBTQ-identied scientists,
technicians, professors, lecturers, graduate students, en-
gineers, and other professionals as well as their straight
colleagues to answer the anonymous online survey, to
help spread the word to everyone who should partici-
pate, and to volunteer for in-depth follow up questions if
they are comfortable. Thanks in advance for your help!
We're looking forward to some exciting new discoveries
about the LGBTQ community and scientic careers.

Our next freely-viewable seminar:
A brief history of computational phylogenetics Joe
Felsenstein (University of Washington) Thursday, Au-
gust 4, 2016, 10:00 AM PDT54 EvolDir August 1, 2016
Abstract: I will discuss the history of the use of com-
puters to infer phylogenies, starting in the late 1950s
and giving particular emphasis to the introduction of
the major methods in the 1960s. Much of this history
I watched happen, from 1965 on. In particular I will
explain the way that work in biological systematics, in
population genetics, and in molecular evolution of multi-
ple species gave rise to the early methods. I will touch on
the controversies that developed in the 1970s and 1980s,
a period of intense conict over what should be the
logical foundation of the reconstruction of phylogenies.
Computational phylogenetics is becoming continually
more statistical and continually less connected to the
separable task of erecting a biological classication of
organisms. Recent Twitter controversies show that ar-
guments that were dominant and vehement in the 1980s
are now taken seriously by few.

Resampling DistanceMatrices
Evoldir,
I have an SSR dataset collected from 360 individu-
als spanning the range of an autopolyploid prairie
species comprising diploids, tetraploids, and hexaploids.
Diploids are quite rare, so we are focusing in the 4x
and 6x individuals. These 4x and 6x cytotypes demon-
strate a highly non-random geographic distribution,
and we would like to explore whether this came about
through some sort of ecological sorting mechanism rather
than historical contingency. In other words (and since
hexaploids likely arose from tetraploids) that hexaploids
are restricted to area X because they experience gen-
erally higher tness than tetraploids in area X, not
because area X is the only place where hexaploids arose
from tetraploids. Said a third way, recurrent origins
of the hexaploids from the tetraploids. Demonstrating
that hexaploids tend to be more genetically similar to
geographically proximate tetraploids would seem to oer
some insight.
A) Does anyone know of a script(s) that would do this
sort of thing (given genetic and geographic distance
matrices, evaluate if group A individuals tend to be
more genetically similar to geographically proximategroup B individuals)? It seems some sort of resampling
approach would do it.
B) Are there any other approaches that come to mind
for this sort of situation and dataset?

Volunteers needed
Evolution and Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the
Succulent Karoo of South Africa
Opportunity: This is a great opportunity for anybody
who wants to get more experience in eld work related to
animal behavior, evolution, eco-physiology, and ecology
before starting an MSc or PhD project.
Project: We study the evolutionary and ecological rea-August 1, 2016 EvolDir 55
sons as well as physiological mechanisms of group living,
paternal care, communal nesting and social exibility
in the striped mouse. One focus is on the adaptation to
droughts, combining physiological, behavioral, ecologi-
cal and evolutionary research. As this species is diurnal
and the habitat is open, direct behavioral observations
in the eld are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students are preferred as
candidates. Applicants must have an interest in
working in the eld and with animals. Hard working
conditions will await applicants, as the study species
gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o` clock), and
stops its activity with dusk (19 o` clock). Work during
nights might also be necessary. Work in the eld will
be done for 5 days a week. Applicants must be able
to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at night in
winter, sometimes over 40 ^AoC during summer days).
Applicants must both be prepared to live for long
periods in the loneliness of the eld and to be part of a
small social group.
Work of volunteer eld assistants: Trapping, marking
and radio-tracking of striped mice; direct behavioral ob-
servations in the eld. Volunteers will also see how blood
samples are collected for physiological measurements.
Volunteers are expected to help with maintenance of
the research station (water pump, solar power, etc.).
Conrmation letter: Students get a letter of conrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their univer-
sity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
eld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
1450 (around 175 US $, 100 Euro) must be paid for ac-
commodation at the research station. Students must
buy their own food etc in Springbok (costs of about R
3000, approx. 350 US $or 250 Euro/month). Includ-
ing extras (going out for dinner; shopping), you should
expect costs of about 600 US $/ 450 Euros per month.
Students get an invitation letter which they can use to
apply for funding in their home country.
Place: The eld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is adesert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: We are looking for volunteers to
start any time in 2016 as well as beginning of 2017.
Volunteers are expected to stay for 2-3 months.
How to apply? Send a short motivation let-
ter stating why and for which period you are
interested and your CV via email to succu-
lent.karooo.research.station@kabelbw.de.

Evolution of mating patterns in a cooperative songbird
A 36-month postdoctoral position is available to study
the evolutionary quantitative genetics of mating sys-
tems in a wild bird population. The project would in-
vestigate the evolutionary processes that shape mating
and breeding systems, and in particular the evolution
of mate choice, the dynamics of sexual selection and
the interaction of these factors with the social environ-
ment. It will use data from a long-term study of superb
fairy-wrens, a cooperatively-breeding passerine bird with
exceptionally high levels of extra-pair paternity. The
data-set comprises detailed records on individual life
histories, mating patterns, relatedness and population
spatial structure. The aim of the project is to address
fundamental evolutionary questions about patterns of
variation in breeding success and the role of indirect
genetic eects and inclusive tness.
The post constitutes an exciting opportunity for a highly-
motivated postdoctoral researcher with experience in
evolutionary ecology and/or quantitative genetic anal-
yses. It will involve statistical analyses of a long-term
data-set as well as eldwork, in collaboration withLoeske Kruuk and Andrew Cockburn in ANU's Division
of Evolution, Ecology and Genetics.
Applicants should possess (or be nearing completion
of) a PhD in a relevant area of evolutionary ecology
or genetics. They should have strong skills in complex
statistical analyses; in particular, whilst familiarity with
quantitative genetic mixed models is by no means essen-
tial, it would be a strong advantage. They should also
be able to demonstrate excellent writing skills and a
strong track record of publication in academic journals.
The position is available for 36 months. Start date could
be as soon as possible dependent on red tape, and the
salary would be $81,122 p.a. plus 17% superannuation.

recombination in humans and other species, and on
modeling and detecting the footprints of natural selec-
tion in genetic variation data. For more information,
see: http://przeworski.c2b2.columbia.edu/ This search
is for a postdoc interested in mutation processes and
their evolution. The specics of the project are exible,
but will likely include both data analysis and model-

CornellU.Ornithology The Cornell Lab of Ornithology
invites applications for our Edward W. Rose Postdoc-
toral Fellowships. These competitive postdoctoral fellow-
ship awards (www.birds.cornell.edu/postdoc) support
innovative, independent research by early career scholars
of exceptional promise. Multiple Rose Fellowships are
available annually, with applications due on September
8. All Rose Fellows join a vibrant community of more
than a dozen concurrent postdocs within the Rose Post-
doctoral Program and interact with many other scholars
across a wide range of disciplines.
The Rose Postdoctoral Fellowship awards support indi-
viduals pursuing cutting-edge scholarship, while foster-
ing intellectual interaction with multiple Lab programs
and Cornell scholars. Any area of inquiry related to
the Lab's mission \to interpret and conserve the earth's
biological diversity through research, education, and
citizen science focused on birds" is appropriate. Poten-
tial applicants are encouraged to learn more about the
Cornell Lab and our formal programs in Bioacoustics,

available in 2017 will be accepted until September 8,
2016. The selection committee is chaired by Dr. Irby
Lovette (IJL2@cornell.edu), Fuller Professor of Ornithol-
ogy and Associate Director for Academic Aairs at the
Lab.
Edward W. Rose, known by family and friends as
\Rusty," joined the Lab's Administrative Board in 1993
and served as its Chairman from 2004 to 2014. Rusty
was a brilliant man who inspired everyone at the Lab,
not only through his infectious laugh but even more
by asking tough questions, expecting excellence, and
seeking global impact. Rusty had a deep conservation
ethos which he exemplied both in his own actions and
through his support of the Cornell Lab and kindred
institutions. He was among the Lab's most enthusias-
tic promoters of early career scientists, and he always
relished learning about their discoveries and accom-
plishments. Rusty passed away in January 2016, but
his legacy endures in many contexts, including the Ed-ward W. Rose Postdoctoral Fellowship Program which
brings together the Lab's entire postdoctoral community.
Through the generosity of Rusty and his wife Deedie,
together with that of fellow board members Larry and
Nancy Fuller, Russ and Carol Faucett, and Imogene

Finland AdaptiveFescueTraits
INTERESTED IN EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY OF
PLANT-MICROBE INTERACTIONS?
POSTDOCTORAL POSITION
We are looking for an enthusiastic and highly motivated
postdoctoral scientist to work on a four-year research
project \Heritability of adaptive fescue traits in chang-
ing climate" funded by Academy of Finland. The work
continues our long-term research on the ecology and
evolution of interactions between plants, microbes and
herbivores. Strong collaboration with several national
and international research groups, and the previously
collected extensive plant material across Europe provide
a solid basis for this work.
The present project aims to understand the mechanisms
underlying phenotypic variation of ecologically relevant
traits in red fescue (Festuca rubra) and its symbiotic
fungal Epichlo eendophyte. The closely linked tness of
the Epichlo esymbiont and the host grass is presumed
to align the coevolution of the species towards special-
ization and mutually benecial cooperation. Here we
will examine what is the relative importance of phe-
notypic plasticity, endophyte presence, and heritable
variation including changes in DNA sequence and epi-
genetic modications in red fescue adaptations across
dierent latitudes. The approach includes rigorous, ma-
nipulative eld experiments and lab work on genes that
are responsible of traits that are ecologically important.
The research will be conducted at Natural Resources
Institute Finland (Luke) in Turku and/or Helsinki.August 1, 2016 EvolDir 67
Candidates who are self-motivated and career-oriented
are welcome to join an exciting and highly interactive
research team. The candidate should enjoy working
both in the eld and in the lab. The ideal applicant will
have a background in evolutionary ecology, molecular
biology or other relevant biological sciences, show scien-
tic curiosity and be capable of working independently.
Strong demonstrated communication and writing skills
are essential.
Applications should consist of a short cover letter, a
curriculum vitae, a publication list, and the names and
contact information of two referees. Applications should
be addressed to Kari Saikkonen preferably by e-mail
(kari.saikkonen@luke.). Review of applications will

PostDoc: Evolution of Bioluminescence and Light De-
tection in the Deep Sea
The Bracken-Grissom Lab at Florida International Uni-
versity in the Department of Biology and Marine Sci-
ences Program is looking for a postdoctoral fellow to
work on a NSF-funded project to study the evolution
of bioluminescence and vision in deep-sea shrimp. This
position is for 1-year with possible extension dependent
on performance.
The CRUSTOMICS Lab is fundamentally interested
in using genomic techniques to study the evolution
and adaptation of marine invertebrates with a focus
on crustaceans. We are searching for a postdoc to lead
a recently funded NSF project aimed to test several
hypotheses addressing the evolution of bioluminescence
and light detection in the deep sea. As part of this
project the postdoctoral fellow will use phylogenomicmethods to trace the evolution of dierent biolumi-
nescence modes across deep-sea shrimp. In addition,
RNA-Seq will be used to characterize the visual systems
and bioluminescence organs within a comparative frame-
work. Experience with wet-lab molecular techniques,
phylogenomics, transcriptomics (RNA-Seq), large data
matrices, associated analyses and software, and bioin-
formatics is required. Additional experience with visual
system ecology and opsin evolution is a plus. In addition
to research, mentoring of graduate and undergraduate
students and lab manager duties are expected as part of
this position. The successful candidate must have com-
pleted her/his doctoral degree before taking the position.
Our work requires good organizational and computa-
tional skills and the ability to work collaboratively as
part of a team. Occasional physically demanding eld-
work (research cruises) may also be required to support
research.
Additional information on the lab's research, the biol-
ogy department, and marine sciences program can be
found here: and *www.brackengrissomlab.com, http://-
biology.u.edu/ and www.u.edu/ ~marine . *Require-
ments*: As a *single PDF*, applications must include
a 1) cover letter briey outlining the candidate's t to
the position 2) curriculum vitae 3) research statement,

GenomicsSexDierences
Postdoc opportunity for 2 years in the research group
of Dr Urban Friberg at IFM Biology, Linkoping Uni-
versity Sweden. Our research group has a broad
general interest in the area of evolutionary biol-
ogy/genetics/genomics, and ongoing projects focus on
the evolution of ageing and the genetics/genomics of
sexual dimorphism (see https://www.liu.se/forskning/-
foass/urban-friberg?l=en for more information).
Most sexual species exhibit distinct dierences between
the sexes, despite males and females sharing the same
genome. How this is accomplished is yet not fully
understood. We use the model organism Drosophila
melanogaster to learn more about this phenomenon.
The successful applicant is expected to primarily work
on two projects: one which aims to molecularly char-acterize the genetics of a recent reversal in male and
female body size, and a second aimed to enhance our
understanding of the genomics of condition dependent
sexual dimorphism. The successful applicant will also
have the opportunity to develop own ideas related to
these questions.
We seek a bright, highly motivated and enthusias-
tic person able to work both as part of a team and
independently, having a PhD in evolutionary biol-
ogy/genetics/genomics. Documented experience in one
or several of the following topics is highly benecial:
statistics, quantitative genetics, Drosophila genetics/lab
work, bioinformatics, and in particular analyses of
RNAseq data. The working language at the depart-
ment and in the lab is English. A high standard of
spoken and written English is required. For further in-
quiries about the position, please contact Urban Friberg
(urban.friberg@liu.se).
Link oping University is a modern university with a

LundU SocialEvolution
A postdoctoral fellowship is available for 3 years to work
on the evolution of multicellularity
The fellow will work with researchers in the molecular
ecology and evolution lab and the aquatic ecology group
at the Department of Biology, Lund University.
The position will focus on understanding what predis-August 1, 2016 EvolDir 71
poses some species to undergo a major evolutionary tran-
sition, with particular focus on predicting why species
go from being unicellular to multicellular.
Over evolutionary time there have been several major
transitions that have shaped contemporary patterns of
organismal complexity. In each of these transitions a
group of individuals that previously replicated indepen-
dently joined together to form a new, more complex
life form. For example, unicells joined together to form
multicellular bodies, asexual organisms combined to re-
produce sexually and individual organisms have foregone
independence to live in groups.
The project will use a combination of experimental evolu-
tion on target groups (e.g. green algae), and comparative
analyses of the independent transitions to multicellu-
arity across the tree of life using genomic, ecological
and life-history data. This position will provide the
opportunity to explore social evolutionary theory and
develop skills in experimental design, bioinformatics,
phylogenetic comparative methods and meta-analysis.
The post-doc will also be supported by a technician.
The Department of Biology at Lund has a number of
research units studying a range of ecological and evo-
lutionary topics including aquatic ecology, microbial
evolution, speciation, sexual selection, and host-parasite
coevolution, and the post-doctoral fellow will be inte-
grated across these dierent units.
Description of the qualications that are required of the
candidate
Applicants should have completed a PhD within the
elds of Evolution, Ecology or Molecular Biology within
four years from application deadline. Candidates should
have a keen interest in general evolutionary theory
and demonstrate an ability to be work both indepen-
dently and in teams with other researchers, including
co-supervising PhD and MSc students. Experience and
skills in the following areas is essential: experimenta-
tion using algal and/or other microorganisms, molecular
genetic analyses and laboratory work. Experience and
skills in the following areas is desirable: bioinformatics,
experimental evolution, linear mixed modeling and phy-
logenetic comparative analysis. Complementary training
will be provided where needed.
Fluent written and spoken English is essential with a
strong record of publishing in internationally recognized
scientic journals. The scientic aptitude and the ability
to develop and carry out high-quality research within
the subject area will be given special attention in the
assessment of the candidate. Importance will be at-
tached to the potential of the candidate to develop as
an independent researcher.Salary will be set according to the general regulations
for postdoctoral positions at Lund University in rela-
tion to the number of years research experience and
achievements. Applicants should send a cover letter
explaining their background, research interests and mo-

MNHN Paris Biogeography
#### Postdoctoral position in macroecology and bio-
geography at the MNHN, Paris, France ####
The Mus eum national d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN,
Paris) invites applications for a full-time 2-year post-
doctoral position in macroecology and biogeography of
phytophagous insects.
The MNHN is a world-class research institution that
aims to document and understand global and local bio-
logical and ecological diversity, disseminate the results
of these studies to a broad academic and non-academic
audience, and contribute to high-level education at all
stages of the curriculum. The position will be based
within the Institute for Systematics, Evolution and Bio-
diversity (ISYEB UMR 7205 CNRS, MNHN), a research
unit hosting more than 90 researchers whose investi-
gations address questions in systematics, evolutionary
biology and ecology, biogeography and macroecology
on a variety of non-model organisms in all kingdoms of
Life.
The successful applicant will work under the supervi-
sion of Dr. Rodolphe Rougerie as part of the research
program ACTIAS (http://www.cesab.org/index.php/-
en/projets-en-cours/projets-2014/130-actias), funded by
the Center for Synthesis and Analysis of Biodiversity
(CESAB). One of the main objectives of the ACTIAS
project is to carry out a global-scale macroecological
analysis of two of the best-documented families of moths
(Sphingidae & Saturniidae), highlighting areas where72 EvolDir August 1, 2016
species diversity and evolutionary distinctness are con-
centrated and most threatened. It will represent the
rst such analysis on a global scale for a diverse group of
invertebrates ( >4500 species; see Ballesteros et al., 2016
[doi: 10.1111/ecog.02438] for an example of what has
recently been achieved by members of our consortium
on Old-World Sphingidae species), made possible by the
wealth of existing diversity, distributional, ecological
and phylogenetic information available for these moths,
including an almost comprehensive species-level DNA
barcode database.
The ACTIAS program is run by an international consor-
tium of 12 researchers (see link above for a list) from ve
countries. Working under Dr. Rougerie at the MNHN,
but in close collaboration with the other members of the
ACTIAS consortium, the postdoc will: (1) develop and
implement the pipeline for the construction of Species
Distribution Models (SDMs) for all databased species;
(2) carry out macroecological analyses of relevant mea-
sures of diversity (e.g., species richness, evolutionary
distinctness, phylogenetic diversity); (3) compare these
patterns with those already existing for plants and ver-
tebrates; (4) analyze their t to current conservation
measures, rarely critically examined for invertebrates;
and (5) contribute to a synthesis of macroecological
patterns and eco-evolutionary analysis of diversication
in these moths. The postdoc will lead the assembly
of manuscripts in collaboration with members of the
consortium and also participate in and contribute to
the organization of four consortium meetings (two in
2017 and two in 2018) at the CESAB headquarters in
Aix-en-Provence.
#### Qualications ####
We are seeking applicants holding a PhD degree in ecol-
ogy, macroecology, biogeography or related discipline
(e.g., conservation biology, evolutionary ecology), with
a solid theoretical background and a strong publication
record in these elds, proven expertise in applied and
spatial statistics, and with a keen interest in global
patterns of insect diversity and in ecological model-
ing. The ACTIAS database will collate distribution
records that have or lack DNA barcodes and will be
hosted within the Barcode of Life Datasystems (BOLD;
www.boldsystems.org). The postdoc will develop R
scripts and pipelines that can be implemented within
the BOLD API system. We thus expect applicants to
have demonstrable skills in writing R scripts.
In addition, applicants should have: §Expertise in the
use of GIS for analysis and visualization; §Fluency in En-
glish, excellent communication skills and a willingness to
organize and lead workshops/meetings; §Experience in
presenting and communicating results at internationalconferences and through publications in high-quality
peer-reviewed journals; §An excellent understanding of
biodiversity data management.
Desirable skills include an interest in insect diversity,
experience in participating in research programs that
analyze large datasets, and a broader coding aptitude
(e.g., Python) that would facilitate the integration of
analytical pipelines in the BOLD API system.
#### Conditions of employment ####
We oer a fully funded, two-year fellowship of 2500
euros/month (gross salary, health insurance included).

Post-doc in Human Population Genetics, Eco-
Anthropology, Paris
A one-year post-doctoral position starting in Fall 2016 is
available in the human population genetics group at the
Mus ee de l'Homme (Unit of Eco-Anthropology and Eth-
nobiology), Paris. The project is aimed at exploring the
biological and cultural factors inuencing mate choice in
Humans using genomic data. Mate choice in Humans is
mainly under the inuence of socio-cultural factors, but
previous works (Chaix 2008; Laurent 2012a; Laurent
2012b) suggest that some biological factors such as the
MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex), as well as
other regions of the genome (Laurent 2012c), may also
inuence mate choice.
Previous studies have been performed on samples of
small size from a restricted number of populations. Here
we aim at extending this research to new samples. We
have developed a powerful methodological framework
enabling to detect similarities or dierences between hus-
bands and wives from genomic data. This framework
allows distinguishing biological factors that leave local
genomic signatures, from socio-cultural factors (such
as cousin marriages or a tendency for geographical en-
dogamy) that leave genome-wide signatures. We wish
to explore new population samples, more precisely sev-
eral hundreds of couples sampled in Central Asia and
South-East Asia in populations having dierent social
organizations.
The ideal candidate will have expertise in population
genomics and/or bioinformatics, a solid background in
statistics and computing (R, python...) and a strong
interest in social sciences. The start date is exible, but
should be between October 2016 and January 2017.

Compensation:
Let's face it, postdoc pay sucks. Salaries will be based
on NIH scales with some exibility depending on the
funding level of the lab at the time. In addition to med-
ical and life insurance, Rutgers oers not-too-shabby
retirement benets.
Advice/Mentoring/Support:
In addition to being your scientic mentor, my primary
responsibilities would be towards your personal and
professional growth. You will always nd an audience
to discuss opportunities and challenges, and a strong

TelAvivU IrisFlowerColorEvolution
The Sapir Lab at Tel Aviv University, Israel, is look-
ing to hire a postdoctoral fellow to join an ISF-funded
project on the evolution of ower color in the irises of
section Oncocyclus. Research in the lab encompasses
plant ecology, conservation, molecular ecology and some
crazy ideas about plant-pollinator interactions. Our
questions are centered on understanding ecological de-
terminants of oral trait evolution and identifying the
mechanisms that underlie changes in oral traits (see
lab research page).
The postdoc will lead research aimed at linking genotype
and phenotype of pigment synthesis genes and their as-
sociated oral color, and estimating natural selection on
oral color in natural and articial settings. The study
is in the Middle-Eastern endemic Oncocyclus species of
the genus Iris. These plants are unique by their highly
diverse oral color, from white and light pink to purple
and black. Also distinctive is the extreme dark colors
of the owers, shown to be associated with heat reward
to the pollinators (See Sapir et al., 2005, 2006).
This project builds on previous contrasting studies,
one suggesting that dark-colored owers are favored
by the pollinators of the irises (Sapir et al., 2006), while
the other (Lavi & Sapir, 2015) showed no pollinator-
mediated selection on ower color in two species. In
order to solve this puzzling contradiction, we will em-
ploy a series of tests, including accurate measure of
color variation, measuring both male and female tness,
and by stretching the natural variation by (a) using
the large Iris collection in the botanical garden, (b)
measuring natural selection on color in the two most
diverse populations, one coastal and one in the desert,
and (c) building articial owers of irises and printing
3-D owers in the shape of irises in various colors.
The project includes also the identication of genes un-
derlying anthocyanin pigment synthesis, verication of
their biochemical activity and measure their expression
in natural population. this will enable to connect the
molecular level with ecological eects, to understand the
evolutionary process governing color evolution in owers.
Till now, this was done in model plants with discrete
color morphs (Petunia, Mimulus...). This project willbe the rst to use CONTINUOUS ower color, which
gets to extreme dark (black) owers.
Qualied candidates will have a PhD in biology or re-
lated disciplines and a strong publication record. Expe-
rience in plant biochemistry/ development/ molecular
biology and/or analysis of next-generation sequence data
is a plus. To apply for the positions, please send a brief
letter of interest (1-2 paragraphs), a CV, and the names
and contact information for three references to Yuval
Sapir, sapiry@post.tau.ac.il. The position is available
for 1 year with the possibility of renewal for up to two
additional years depending on research progress. The
start date is exible, but could be as early as November
1st, 2016. Review of applications will begin on August
24, 2016 and will continue until the position is lled.

between landscape heterogeneity and physiological, ge-
netic, and genome-level variation in carnivores. Building
on our 35,000+ repository of wolf, coyote, fox, lynx and
bobcat fur and tissue samples, we aim to determine how
carnivore stress levels, diet breadth, and genetics vary ac-
cording to environmental factors like climate, habitat, or
anthropogenic activity. There is further opportunity to
investigate processes underlying spatio-temporal varia-
tion in patterns of dispersal and population connectivity,
and the contribution of environmental variability and
intrinsic features of the individual animal to such pro-
cesses. Of particular interest is the role of climate change
on stress levels and diet breadth, as well as potential
variation in functional genes especially in environments
undergoing rapid change. Our recent work (mostly on
lynx and coyotes) sets the foundation for this work,
and our next challenge is to develop a more compre-
hensive understanding of physiological-dietary-genetic
linkages across carnivore species and through space and
time. Our team has access to abundant samples and
state-of-the-art analytical facilities and equipment to
address these research questions, and the successful
candidate will have the opportunity to develop his/her
own research interests within the scope of the broader
program.
Applicants must have a strong academic record and
graduate degree(s) in Biology, Physiology, Ecology, Ge-netics or a related eld. Candidates with an interest
in and/or knowledge of hormone assays, stable isotope
analysis, DNA extraction, bioinformatics, or other rel-

Dear Evoldir:
I have posted two ads for postdoc positions over the past
few months. Unfortunately, there was a hacking inci-
dent here at University of Calgary and as a result I have
lost all my old emails, including some applications for
the positions. If you previously applied for one of these
positions and haven't heard from me, please contact
me to double check that I still have your application.Otherwise, I am currently reviewing applications, so
please contact me if you're interested!
My apologies for the problems this has caused,

Postdoctoral positions: Genomics of local adaptation
Yeaman Lab
Department of Biological Sciences, University of Calgary
I am looking to hire two postdoctoral fellows to collabo-
rate on projects studying how patterns in the genome
evolve during local adaptation:
1. Genomic rearrangements and local adaptation:
This project will develop and use comparative ge-
nomic approaches to study whether rearrangements
have contributed to the evolution of clusters of function-
ally related genes (genomic islands, metabolic clusters,
etc.). We are currently working on an assembly of
the tubesnout genome (a relative of stickleback) as a
means of studying if/where/when rearrangements have
contributed to the evolution of clustered architectures
observed in the stickleback. We will also be exploring
patterns in a range of already-assembled genomes, and
there is some budget exibility to play around with new
ideas. Good bioinformatics and R-scripting skills will be
very important, ideally with experience in comparative
genomics.
2. Genomics of local adaptation to abiotic stress in
sunower: For this project, we will be studying whole
genome sequence data from over 600 individuals, search-
ing for associations with environment and signatures of
selection, and developing new methods for data analysis.
It is a large-scale collaboration with Loren Rieseberg
and John Burke, funded by Genome Canada. Experi-
ence managing and analyzing NGS data, GWAS, and
related approaches would be ideal, coupled with strong
R & unix skills.
Positions will run for 2+ years (CAD $50k salary).
TO APPLY: Please send a CV and a short description
of your interest in the position to samuel.yeaman at
ucalgary.ca, along with the names and emails of three
people I could contact for reference letters. I will begin
reviewing applications on July 1st, 2016, but please con-
tact me to check in if you need to make a quick decision.
I will be at SSE and CSEE this summer, so please get
in touch if you'd like to chat with me about it then!

EvolutionDevelNetworks
A postdoctoral position on the evolution of genetic net-
works and development is available starting as soon as
Sept 1 2016 in the lab of Scott Rifkin at UC, San Diego.
There are two potential research projects:
The rst uses the Caenorhabditis genus as a model
system for studying the phenomenon of morphological
stasis or robustness.Caenorhabditis worms are famous
for their highly stereotyped and invariant pattern of de-
velopment, but beneath this is a substantial amount of
genetic change.The project would focus on the mechan-
ics and evolution of developmental decisions in early
embryogenesis and involve single molecule resolution
measurements of gene expression, 4-D microscopy, and,
potentially, mathematical modeling.
The second project investigates how genetic networks are
organized so as to buer or amplify stochastic, genetic,
and environmental variation.The focus will be on the
evolution of the dauer decision, a ecologically and evolu-
tionarily crucial life-history decision in Caenorhabditis
where all three types of variation of variation play a role.
Techniques would involve microuidics, microscopy, im-
age processing, and genetic engineering, and, potentially,
mathematical modeling and experimental evolution.
Candidates must have an experimental background, ide-
ally with worms. As both projects involve substantial
analysis of microscopy images and variation, experience
in programming, image analysis, and/or statistics are
preferred.Only candidates with lead authorship on at
least one substantial published project will be consid-
ered.

36-MONTH POSTDOC POSITION AT THE UNIVER-
SITY OF GDANSK (POLAND)
Bioinformatician in a large project on orchid symbiosis
and metabolism
Fields of interest and research objective: Prof. M.-A.
Selosse's team is based in Brazil (Vi A^A), France (Na-
tional Museum of Natural History, MNHN-Paris) and
Poland (Gdansk) and studies the ecology and evolution
of mycorrhizal symbiosis, i.e. the association of plant
roots with soil fungi, in tropical and temperate regions.
The current project focuses on our special interest in
mycorrhizae of temperate orchids and their role in plant
physiology. In most cases, fungi provide soil minerals
to the plant, in exchange for photosynthetic sugar. Yet,
during orchid germination, the fungi provide carbon
to germinating seedlings that have no reserve. More-
over, in some orchid species, adult plants also recover
carbon from their fungi: some are achlorophyllous and
non-photosynthetic (mycoheterotrophic species) while
others are green and mix photosynthesis with exploita-
tion of fungal carbon (mixotrophic species). We aim tostudy these various nutritional strategies (germination,
adult autotrophy, mycoheterotrophy and mixotrophy)
within several evolutionary and ecological frameworks,
using metabolomic and transcriptomic approaches in
situ. These original approaches open the way to a fully
new integrated vision of plant biology.
Research environment: The research is funded by the Na-
tional Science Centre (Maestro7-NZ project entitled Or-
chidomics to M.-A. Selosse) at the University of Gdansk
(UG, Poland) from 2016 to 2020. The position will be
based in the Department of Plant Taxonomy and Nature
Conservation, within which a team of 4 full researchers
and 2 PhDs will focus on Orchidomics. The team will
access various facilities of UG according to project needs.
The candidate will be part of the international network
of renowned European scientic institutions involved
in Orchidomics. This includes Adam Mickiewicz Uni-
versity in Pozna A1^ ae(Prof. I. Maka A1^ a), the Faculty
of Biotechnology of UG and the Medical University
of Gda A1^ a(Prof. E. A1 >1
2ojkowska), MNHN in Paris
(Prof. M.-A. Selosse) and its Molecular Facilities (Dr.
R. Debruyne), and the University of Fribourg (P.-E.
Courty). He/She may contribute as a co-author to
other projects, started or yet to be launched, within this
network and in Brazil. He/She will also help organise
an international congress on mycorrhizal ecology and
physiology in 2019.
Responsibilities and required skills: The ambitious Or-
chidomics project needs candidates with strong bioin-
formatics skills. The selected candidate will assume
responsibility for bioinformatics throughout the project.
He/She should have a background (PhD or previous
post-doc) in computational biology and bioinformatics.
With initial help from his/her collaborators at Adam

TWO POSTDOC POSITIONS IN EVOLUTIONARY
SINGLE-CELL GENOMICS (experimental and compu-
tational)
Joint interdisciplinary postdoctoral positions in the re-
search groups of:
Detlev Arendt, European Molecular Biology Labora-
tory (EMBL), Heidelberg Wolfgang Huber, European
Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Heidelberg Hen-
rik Kaessmann, Center for Molecular Biology (ZMBH),
Heidelberg University
Overall topic: Cell types are the fundamental units of
multicellular life. They make up distinct tissues and
organs in vertebrates and invertebrates. However, the
cellular origins and diversication events underlying
the emergence of new animal tissues during evolution
remain poorly understood. The recent revolution in
single-cell genomics technologies now allows for detailed
investigations of the evolutionary and cellular origins of
tissues and organ systems as well as the underlying gene
regulatory networks. We are particularly interested in
the origin and evolution of the vertebrate/bilaterian
nervous system.
The host labs: The three labs combine complemen-
tary expertise in cell type and nervous tissue evo-
lution (Arendt group), statistical computing (Huber
group), and vertebrate evolutionary (functional) ge-
nomics (Kaessmann group). This setting provides a
unique framework for carrying out groundbreaking inter-
disciplinary postdoctoral projects in evolutionary single-
cell biology.
Projects: We call for proposals of specic biological
projects, to be developed by you with feedback from
the three mentors, within the overall frame outlined
above. We envisage that one of the projects will fo-
cus on the development and application of single-cell
sequencing protocols for proling transcriptomes and
epigenomes across tissues and developmental stages from
multiple, carefully selected species. This project will
also include follow-up experiments (e.g., FISH to as-
sess the distribution and abundance of cell types using
markers predicted from whole transcriptome analyses).
The other project will focus on the development of
statistical and bioinformatics approaches for detailed92 EvolDir August 1, 2016
analyses and understanding of single-cell sequencing
data in the evolutionary context. Particular challenges
include spatio-temporal registration and modelling of
cells and the identication of functional homologies and
divergences of cells and their gene regulatory programs.
We expect both projects to take a highly collabora-
tive approach between each other and with the other
members of the host labs. We also expect candidates
to acquire interdisciplinary skills in the course of the
project (i.e., a wet lab postdoc will learn and perform
bioinformatics approaches; a bioinformatics postdoc will
perform targeted experiments).
The candidates: The ideal experimentally oriented can-
didate has experience and strong experimental skills
in molecular and cell biology. Expertise in develop-
mental biology, the biology of specic organs (e.g., the
brain), and/or genome-scale work is a plus. For compu-
tational candidates, we expect outstanding quantitative
and analytical skills. We are looking for candidates with
PhD level education in molecular biology, bioinformat-
ics, statistics, mathematics or a related eld, who aim to
make an impact on our understanding of fundamental as-
pects of cellular evolutionary biology. Experience in the
analysis of high-throughput sequencing data and/or the
development and optimization of statistical approaches
is desired. Experience in the analysis of single-cell ge-
nomic or transcriptomic data is a plus.
Both candidates should ideally be driven by a passion
for evolutionary biology, and both positions require the
ability to independently take responsibility for their
projects, as well as strong teamwork and communica-
tion skills, problem-solving abilities, reliability, attention
to detail and eective time management.
Funding: The selected candidates will be encouraged
to apply for independent funding, including the EMBL
Interdisciplinary Postdocs (EIPOD) fellowship program
(http://www.embl.de/training/postdocs/08-eipod/).
Research environment and location: The language of
our institutes (EMBL and ZMBH) is English and host
scientists from around the world. The institutes are
located in Heidelberg, a picturesque cosmopolitan city
that oers a very stimulating, diverse and collaborative
research environment also thanks to nearby cutting-
edge institutions, such as the German Cancer Research
Center (DKFZ) and the Center for Organismal Studies
(COS).

ConservationAndGeneExpression
Sep19-23 2
DEADLINE EXTENDED
Genomic variation has been a recent focus in conser-
vation of rare and endangered species. However, the
immediate response to environmental challenges will
likely be determined by gene expression, which will
constrain the ecacy of response and the likelihood of
population persistence. Nonetheless, gene expression
has been poorly studied in natural populations facing
environmental and anthropogenic threats. This 5-day
workshop at Asilomar, a resort on the central California
coast, will focus on providing an overview of the general
approaches to studying gene expression as well as the
molecular and analytical tools needed to initiate and
complete a eld study. We will be oriented toward ques-
tions regarding the conservation of biodiversity, but the
tools and approaches can be applied to a wide variety
of questions. The topics covered will include: 1) RNA
sampling, preservation, extraction and quantication; 2)
library construction and sequencing (RNA-Seq and re-
duced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS)); 3)
ltering, quality control, mapping of reads to transcrip-
tomes and genomes; and 4) statistical analysis, mixed
linear model, WGCNA, GO analysis, TOA and TCA
(for whole blood samples) and other inference techniques;
and 5) interpretation of results and functional analysis.The workshop will not be restricted to taxonomic groups;
it will include examples from plants, invertebrates, and
vertebrates. Applications from University of Califor-
nia graduate and post-graduate community will receive
higher priority as funding is partly due to a UC presi-
dent's oce catalyst award. However, all applications
will be considered. *There will be some special fellow-
ship support for UC students. The $600 registration
includes housing and all meals. Please apply online be-

Course: Introduction to Linux and workows for biol-
ogists>From Monday 14th to Friday 18th November
2016 in Berlin, Germany
Instructor: Dr Martin JonesOverview Most high-throughput bioinformatics work
these days takes place on the Linux command line. The
programs which do the majority of the computational
heavy lifting genome assemblers, read mappers, and an-
notation tools are designed to work best when used with
a command-line interface. Because the command line
can be an intimidating environment, many biologists
learn the bare minimum needed to get their analysis
tools working. This means that they miss out on the
power of Linux to customize their environment and au-
tomate many parts of the bioinformatics workow. This
course will introduce the Linux command line environ-
ment from scratch and teach students how to make the
most of its tools to achieve a high level of productivity
when working with biological data.
Intended audience This workshop is aimed at researchers
and technical workers with a background in biology who
want to learn to use the Linux operating system and
the command line environment. No previous experience
of Linux is required.
Course Programme
Monday 14th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 1 - The design of Linux
In the rst session we briey cover the design of Linux:
how is it dierent from Windows/OSX and how is it
best used? We'll then jump straight onto the command
line and learn about the layout of the Linux lesystem
and how to navigate it. We'll describe Linux's le per-
mission system (which often trips up beginners), how
paths work, and how we actually run programs on the
command line. We'll learn a few tricks for using the
command line more eciently, and how to deal with
programs that are misbehaving. We'll nish this session
by looking at the built in help system and how to read
and interpret manual pages.
Session 2 - System management
We'll rst look at a few command line tools for mon-
itoring the status of the system and keeping track of
what's happening to processor power, memory, and disk
space. We'll go over the process of installing new soft-
ware from the built in repositories (which is easy) and
from source code downloads (which is trickier). We'll
also introduce some tools for benchmarking software
(measuring the time/memory requirements of processing
large datasets).
Tuesday 15th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 3 - Manipulating tabular data
Many data types we want to work with in bioinformat-
ics are stored as tabular plain text les, and here we
learn all about manipulating tabular data on the com-August 1, 2016 EvolDir 107
mand line. We'll start with simple things like extracting
columns, ltering and sorting, searching for text before
moving on to more complex tasks like searching for du-
plicated values, summarizing large les, and combining
simple tools into long commands.
Session 4 - Constructing pipelines
In this session we will look at the various tools Linux has
for constructing pipelines out of individual commands.
Aliases, shell redirection, pipes, and shell scripting will
all be introduced here. We'll also look at a couple of
specic tools to help with running tools on multiple pro-
cessors, and for monitoring the progress of long running
tasks.
Wednesday 16th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 5 - EMBOSS
EMBOSS is a suite of bioinformatics command-line
tools explicitly designed to work in the Linux paradigm.
We'll get an overview of the dierent sequence data
formats that we might expect to work with, and put
what we learned about shell scripting to biological use
by building a pipeline to compare codon usage across
two collections of DNA sequences.
Session 6 - Using a Linux server
Often in bioinformatics we'll be working on a Linux
server rather than our own computer typically because
we need access to more computing power, or to spe-
cialized tools and datasets. In this session we'll learn
how to connect to a Linux server and how to manage
sessions. We'll also consider the various ways of moving
data to and from a server from your own computer, and
nish with a discussion of the considerations we have
to make when working on a shared computer.
Thursday 17th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 7 - Combining methods
In the next two sessions i.e. one full day we'll put
everything we have learned together and implement a
workow for next-gen sequence analysis. In this rst
session we'll carry out quality control on some paired-
end Illumina data and map these reads to a reference
genome. We'll then look at various approaches to au-
tomating this pipeline, allowing us to quickly do the
same for a second dataset.
Session 8 - Combining methods
The second part of the next-gen workow is to call vari-
ants to identify SNPs between our two samples and the
reference genome. We'll look at the VCF le format
and gure out how to lter SNPs for read coverage and
quality. By counting the number of SNPs between each
sample and the/

Introduction to Python for biologists
Monday 5 ^th to Friday 9 ^th December 2016 in Berlin,
Germany
Instructor: Dr Martin Jones
Overview:
Python is a dynamic, readable language that is a popu-
lar platform for all types of bioinformatics work, from
simple one-o scripts to large, complex software projects.
This workshop is aimed at complete beginners and as-
sumes no prior programming experience. It gives an
overview of the language with an emphasis on practical
problem-solving, using examples and exercises drawn
from various aspects of bioinformatics work. After com-
pleting the workshop, students should be in a position
to (1) apply the skills they have learned to tackling
problems in their own research and (2) continue their
Python education in a self-directed way. All course
materials (including copies of presentations, practical
exercises, data les, and example scripts prepared by
the instructing team) will be provided electronically to
participants.
Intended audience:
This workshop is aimed at all researchers and techni-
cal workers with a background in biology who want
to learn programming. The syllabus has been planned
with complete beginners in mind; people with previous
programming experience are welcome to attend as a
refresher but may nd the pace a bit slow. If in doubt,
take a look at the detailed session content below or
drop Martin Jones (martin@pythonforbiologists.com)
an email.
Teaching format:
The workshop is delivered over ten half-day sessions (see
the detailed curriculum below). Each session consists
of roughly a one hour lecture followed by two hours of
practical exercises, with breaks at the organizer's dis-108 EvolDir August 1, 2016
cretion. There will also be plenty of time for students
to discuss their own problems and data.
Assumed background:
Students should have enough biological background to
appreciate the examples and exercise problems (i.e. they
should know about DNA and protein sequences, what
translation is, and what introns and exons are). No
previous programming experience or computer skills
(beyond the ability to use a text editor) are necessary,
but you'll need to have a laptop with Python installed.
Course programme:
Monday 5 ^th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 1-. Introduction
In this session I introduce the students to Python and
explain what we expect them to get out of it and how
learning to program can benet their research. I explain
the format of the course and take care of any housekeep-
ing details (like coee breaks and catering arrangements).
I outline the edit-run-x cycle of software development
and talk about how to avoid common text editing er-
rors. In this session, we also check that the computing
infrastructure for the rest of the course is in place (e.g.
making sure that everybody has an appropriate version
of Python installed). Core concepts introduced: source
code, text editors, whitespace, syntax and syntax errors,
Python versions
Session 2-Output and text manipulation
In this session students learn to write very simple pro-
grams that produce output to the terminal, and in doing
so become comfortable with editing and running Python
code. This session also introduces many of the technical
terms that we'll rely on in future sessions. I run through
some examples of tools for working with text and show
how they work in the context of biological sequence
manipulation. We also cover dierent types of errors
and error messages, and learn how to go about xing
them methodically. Core concepts introduced: termi-
nals, standard output, variables and naming, strings
and characters, special characters, output formatting,
statements, functions, methods, arguments, comments.
Tuesday 6 ^th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30
Session 3-File IO and user interfaces
I introduce this session by talking about the impor-
tance of les in bioinformatics pipelines and workows,
and we then explore the Python interfaces for reading
from and writing to les. This involves introducing
the idea of types and objects, and a bit of discussion
about how Python interacts with the operating system.
The practical session is spent combining the techniquesfrom session 2 with the le IO tools to create basic le-
processing scripts. Core concepts introduced: objects
and classes, paths and folders, relationships between
variables and values, text and binary les, newlines.
Session 4. Flow control 1 : loops
A discussion of the limitations of the techniques learned
in session 3 quickly reveals that ow control is required
to write more sophisticated le-processing programs,
and I introduce the concept of loops. We look at the
way in which Python loops work, and how they can be
used in a variety of contexts. We explore the use of
loops and lists together to tackle some more dicult
problems. Core concepts introduced: lists and arrays,
blocks and indentation, variable scoping, iteration and
the iteration interface, ranges.

*RFP:* Two page proposals to fund small workshops
and/or hackathons on completing the tree of life and
integrating data layers for specic clades. This is the
second set of clade workshops - you can see a sum-
mary from the rst workshop on the *Open Tree of Life
blog*<https://blog.opentreeoife.org/2016/03/09/-
futurephy-clade-workshops/ >. In this round, we partic-
ularly encourage proposals focused on microbes, plantsAugust 1, 2016 EvolDir 109
and fungi. *Proposal deadline:* Aug. 1, 2016 *Meeting
dates:* Oct. 2016 *Location:* Chicago, IL *Participants
per workshop:* 10 maximum funded (virtual attendees
possible) *Contacts:* mwestneat@uchicago.edu (Future-
Phy), karen.cranston@gmail.com (OpenTree), lukejhar-
mon@gmail.com (Arbor)
The challenges to completing the Tree of Life and inte-
grating data layers (NSF GoLife goals) are huge and vary
across clades. Some groups have a nearly-complete tree
but lack publicly available data layers, whereas other
groups lack phylogenetic resolution or the resources to
support tree / data integration. Partnering with Open
Tree of Life and Arbor Workows, FuturePhy will sup-
port a series of clade-based workshops to identify and
solve specic challenges in tree of life synthesis and data
layer integration.
Proposals should focus on challenges in completing the
tree of life and integrating data layers for a clade or
clades of interest. Cross-fertilization among systematists
and other elds is desired, with focus on phylogenetic
challenges, data layer development, and/or tree-data
integration and analyses. How can developers of Ar-
bor, OpenTree and other resources develop tools to help
solve these challenges? What tools and infrastructure
are needed for others to solve similar problems?
Proposals (using the *proposal template*
< https://docs.google.com/document/d/-
1SJbzT2h1oPGOCGDsETfPjAI8ZKDhrgIS9odZPuxySPw/-
edit>) should include (1) the status of the phylogeny
for your group, including availability of trees in Dryad,
TreeBASE or Open Tree of Life, (2) target data
layers for the workshops, indicating the locations and
accessibility of the data, (3) key biological questions
that you would like to ask, given availability of trees and
data layers, (4) roadmap to tangible products, with a
clear timeline, (5) the challenges to phylogeny and data
synthesis in your clade, with specic targets scoped for
progress towards a solution during the workshop, (6)
evidence that public data exist as a starting point or
access to data that can be made public.
General plans & logistics. Each workshop may involve
up to 10 funded attending participants, with the rst
set of workshops to happen in parallel at the same time
and location. Open Tree of Life, FuturePhy and Arbor
personnel will be there to demo, discuss and plan im-
plementation. Each group should involve participants
familiar with data analysis / integration / use of web
services (e.g., in R, python). Groups can focus anywhere
on the spectrum of completing phylogeny to integrating
data layers. Groups agree to make assembled data or
tools publicly available and to provide a post-workshop
report after the event. Phylogenetic data will be incor-porated into Open Tree of Life.
*Evaluation.* Proposals will be evaluated on (1) the
feasibility of solving the specic challenges, including
evidence for publicly-available data; (2) participant di-
versity (discipline, career stages, gender, ethnicity), (3)
participant expertise, (4) how solving these challenges
will benet researchers in other clades, (5) potential for
increasing public data, tools, products, and contributing
trees to Open Tree of Life and related initiatives.

Hi Everyone-
We are oering a Fall Workshop in Introductory Bioin-
formatics
Where/when: University of Maryland College Park,
Maryland September 15-18, 2016
The handling of large datasets has become intractable
without some level of bioinformatic literacy. Many bi-
ologists nd that there is a steep learning curve to de-
velop the condence required to explore their genomics
datasets eectively. This bioinformatics short course
includes a rich collection of hands-on instruction and
lectures specically intended to help novice users be-
come comfortable with a range of tools currently used to
analyze deep sequencing data. There is no prerequisite
for this course other than a willingness to learn and to
work hard throughout the week. All workshop exercises
will be implemented via VirtualBox and focus primarily
on Illumina data; however, we will also include PacBio
data during the genome assembly tutorial. Course par-
ticipation is limited to 25 students to ensure an intimate
learning environment. Course tuition is $800 and is
open to graduate students, postdocs, sta, faculty, and
industry researchers on a rst come basis.110 EvolDir August 1, 2016

ImprovingGeneticStatistics Nov7-9
The National Institute for Mathematical and Biological
Synthesis (NIMBioS), an NSF funded synthesis cen-
ter located at the University of Tennessee, is seeking
applicants for a workshop on improving analytical ap-
proaches in conservation and population genetics. The
workshop will be Nov 7-9. A brief summary is below
and more information and a link to apply can be found
here: http://www.nimbios.org/workshops/WS nextgen
DEADLINE TO APPLY IS VERY SOON- JULY 24. Fi-
nancial support for travel, meals, and lodging (typically
full funding) is available for workshop attendees.
As biodiversity loss accelerates and environmental chal-
lenges mount, there is need for quantitative evaluation
of the status and trends of genetic biodiversity. How-
ever, appropriate mathematical tools for this evaluation
are lacking. Despite major recent advances in obtaininggenetic data, current genetic metrics are piecemeal, may
be incomparable across studies and data types, and are
often collected and presented in an ad hoc manner.
There is urgent need to conceive and develop standard,
summary-level genetic indices that are robust, easily in-
terpretable and tractable across diverse datasets. In this
workshop we will develop a framework for constructing
these mathematical tools. Specically, we will: iden-
tify key attributes of successful indices in biodiversity
science, survey and critique existing genetic metrics,
and identify potential statistical approaches suitable for
summarizing the highly dimensional nature of genetic
data. We hope the workshop will inspire synthesis pa-
pers, new collaborations, and research funding proposals
for developing, evaluating and distributing new genetic
indices. The inherent challenges of our aims require
participants from diverse elds: statistics, mathemat-
ics, ecology, evolutionary biology, conservation science,
complexity, genetics, network and biodiversity science.
Please apply if you have interest in these elds and
appreciate broad collaboration and cross-disciplinary
work.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed116 EvolDir August 1, 2016
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
