HumboldtU MetazoanPhylogeny
Mar3-6
Dear evolutionary biologists,
the “Deep Metazoan Phylogeny” Program of the Ger-
man Science Foundation (DFG) invites you to the inter-
national conference *“Celebrating Darwin: From /The
Origin of Species/ to Deep Metazoan Phylogeny”.*
Registration is open: * http://www.dmp2009.org*
SCOPE:
Darwin’s 1859 book “On the Origin of Species” con-
tained only a single ﬁgure depicting a tree diagram of
species origins and relationships. This little scheme was
nevertheless the starting point for the ubiquity of phy-
logenetic trees in today’s zoology. Every week numer-
ous cladograms representing animal relationships at all
levels are published. An increasing number of these ar-
ticles deal with the phylogeny of the major groups of
multicellular animals (Metazoa). However, these pub-
lications show that neither sequence data nor available
morphological character sets produce phylogenies that
converge to a widely accepted consensus. It is obvious
that some traditional views cannot be maintained and
that a new framework of animal phylogeny is emerging.
Nevertheless, the large number of contradicting trees
indicates that some fundamental problems of phyloge-
netic studies have not been discovered or resolved.
The international conference *“Celebrating Darwin:
From /The Origin of Species/ to Deep Metazoan Phy-
logeny” *brings together mathematicians, theorists,
molecular systematists, and morphologists interested in
a critical review of known pitfalls and in the presenta-
tion of new analytical tools, new types of characters,
and a synopsis of molecular and morphological charac-
ters. It is intended to get a critical and constructive
view of the state of the art.
On behalf of the organising committee we would like to
invite you to this conference, which will take place from
*3th - 6th March 2009 *at the Humboldt-University
and the Museum of Natural History in Berlin, Germany.
The meeting will consist of sessions with several invited
speakers and open sessions with short presentations. In
addition, there will be the possibility to show posters.
The meeting focuses on three major themes:
*1) Innovations in analyses of molecular and morpho-logical data*
*2) Molecular phylogeny: new markers and phyloge-
nomic analyses*
*3) The indispensability of morphology *
The conference is organised by the Priority Program
“Deep Metazoan Phylogeny” of the German Science
Foundation (DFG). The project is a joint eﬀort of
more than 20 participating workgroups bringing to-
gether molecular, morphological and bioinformatic ex-
pertise with the goal to establish a robust (hopefully)
backbone tree of metazoans. Details on the priority
project “Deep Metazoan Phylogeny” can be found at:
http://www.deep-phylogeny.org/ . For more informa-
tion and to register please visit our website (above).

January 15-17, 2009 In the Light of Evolution III: Two
Centuries of Darwin Organizers: John C. Avise and
Francisco J. Ayala Beckman Center of the National
Academies, Irvine, CA The year 2009 will mark the
200th anniversary of Charles Darwin’s birth and the
150th anniversary of his most inﬂuential publication,
On the Origin of Species, in which he developed the
equally revolutionary concept that a natural but non-
random process - ˆA’ natural selection - ˆA’ yields biolog-
ical adaptations that otherwise can give a superﬁcial
impression of intelligent conscious design.
This colloquium will bring together leading evolution-
ary biologists and science historians to reﬂect upon
and commemorate the Darwinian Revolution. One
goal of this symposium will be to canvass modern
scientiﬁc thought and research approaches regarding
each of the three main categories of selection (natural,
artiﬁcial, and sexual) that Darwin addressed during4 EvolDir December 1, 2008
his career. Although Darwin is associated most often
with his elucidation of natural selection in the Origin,
he also thought and wrote extensively about artiﬁcial
and sexual selection, as reﬂected for example in two
other books titled, respectively, The Variation of
Animals and Plants Under Domestication (1869) and
The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to
Sex (1871). Other goals of this colloquium will be
to place Darwin’s seminal contributions in historical
perspective, and in general to celebrate Darwin’s
ongoing scientiﬁc legacy. A preliminary program

the:
International Congress
Island Evolution 150 Years After Darwin
www.naturalis.nl/darwin2009 150 Years after Darwin’s
On the Origin of Species, island evolution is entering a
new phase. By habitat fragmentation, we humans cre-
ate more and more islands, while at the same time, by
transporting species from their native biomes, we re-
move the dispersal barriers that kept habitats isolated.
To explore the implications of this new era of island evo-
lution, the National Museum of Natural History in Lei-
den, the Netherlands, together with the Darwin Center
for Biogeology in Utrecht, the Netherlands, will organ-
ise an international congress on
“Island Evolution 150 Years After Darwin”
11-13 February 2009 Museum Naturalis Leiden, the
Netherlands
The meeting will bring together traditional students
of island biotas, experimental/theoretical community
ecologists, and evolutionary biologists, to explore the
role of island-biological processes in a world in which
the “island processes” of isolation and dispersal are be-
ing drastically altered.December 1, 2008 EvolDir 5
Registration fee:
Early (before 15 January 2009): EUR 150 (regular par-
ticipants); EUR 100 (students)
Late (15 January 2009 and later): EUR 175 (regular
participants); EUR 125 (students)
The registration fee covers book of abstracts, ice-
breaker, free entry to the museum, lunches, buﬀet din-
ner, Darwin Year opening reception, and refreshments.
Registration closes on January 28th, 2009. Abstracts
for posters (A0 format, 84 x 119 cm) should be submit-
ted to Jeremy Miller (miller@naturalis.nl) before De-

Dec8
International symposium:
New opportunities for conservation genetics with
genome wide information
Monday 8th December 2008, 09.00-17.00, Hotel De
Nieuwe Wereld, Wageningen, the Netherlands
Genetic diversity is of vital importance to cope with
changing environments and human demands. Cur-
rently genetic diversity is under threat, both in the wild
and in crops and domestic animals. With the rapid de-
velopment of molecular biology, methods to measure
genetic variability in detail across the entire genome
are available. This symposium explores the new possi-
bilities for genetic conservation opened up by the latest
molecular technologies.
Program
In the morning various invited speakers will give an
overview of conservation genetics research, related to
plant and animal genetic resources, including the (po-
tential) use of new molecular techniques. Amongst
them are:
Professor John Woolliams (Roslin Institute, UK): From
animal genetic resources to the animal genomic revolu-
tion
Dr. Theo van Hintum (CGN, NL): Conserving and
mining plant genetic resources using knowledge of the
genome
Dr. Richard Crooijmans (WUR, NL): New molecular
technologies in animal biodiversity
In the afternoon, short presentations will be given by
researchers and PhDstudents who are working in the
area of conservation genetics.
Organisation
This symposium is organized by the working group Bio-
diversity within the Animal Breeding and Genomics10 EvolDir December 1, 2008

BehavioralEvolution
Graduate Position in Behavioral Evolution
A PhD position is available in the lab of Lisa An-
geloni at Colorado State University. Motivated stu-
dents interested in evolutionary ecology, sexual selec-
tion, and animal mating behavior are encouraged to
apply. We are investigating the mating strategies of
Trinidadian guppy populations that experience diﬀer-
ent levels of predation pressure in their natural habi-
tats. Predation can aﬀect guppy life history strate-
gies, male color patterns, male mating behavior and
female preferences for male traits. This project fo-
cuses on the interaction between reproductive behavior
and predation pressure, but there are many possible
questions to ask with this system, and a new gradu-
ate student will have the opportunity to help shape
the scope of the project. Applications can be submit-
ted through the Graduate Degree Program in Ecology
(http://www.ecology.colostate.edu ) or the Department
of Biology ( http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/Biology ).
Prior to applying, please send a preliminary statement
of interest (along with a CV or resume) describing pre-
vious research experience, research interests, GPA, and
GRE scores by January 5, 2008 to Lisa Angeloni (an-
geloni@lamar.colostate.edu). Applications will be re-
viewed as they come in, and may also be reviewed after
the target date if the position has not been ﬁlled.

Do bacteria have sex
Dear EvolDir,
I have an opening for a graduate student interested in
using molecular tools to investigate the evolution of nat-
ural competence in bacteria. This is a very controversial
problem that’s also at the heart of a bigger problem -
whether any of the bacterial processes that cause re-
combination have been selected to do so.
Interested students can read more about our work in
the papers, proposals and blogs on our web pages (see
especially the 2007 grant proposal on DNA uptake).
The ideal applicant would have some experience with
both evolutionary biology and molecular biology, but
strengths in one area could compensate for weaknesses
in the other.
Vancouver is frequently ranked as the most liv-
able city in the world, but it’s also a great en-
vironment for molecular and evolutionary biolo-
gists (see for example http://www.lsi.ubc.ca/ and

Dear EvolDir,
I have two 10 month “diplom” positions (German
equivalent of an MSc) to study expression of house-
keeping genes from microdissected tissues taken from
sexual and asexual plants of the genus Boechera (wild
relative of Arabidopsis). The goal of the project(s) will
be to validate gene expression proﬁles across diﬀerent
analysis platforms, and to examine the eﬀects of asex-
ual genome variability on validation results.
If possible, I’m looking for students with some experi-
ence with PCR, DNA sequencing and RNA extractions.
The working language of my group is english.
Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you are interested.

Leipzig PrimateEvolution
Applications invited for a Ph.D position in Molecular
Primatology.
I am looking for a PhD student to conduct a project
aimed at using DNA sequence analysis to improve our
understanding of the evolutionary histories of primate
populations. Primates in the wild exist in populations
with very varied distributions. For example, some pri-
mates may occur in fragmented patches in a restricted
area, whereas others may be quite widespread. Some
closely-related species occupy widely separated ranges,
while others occur adjacent to one another and may
even hybridize along their contact zone. The wealth of
nuclear genome sequence information newly available
from chimpanzees, macaques, and other primates en-
able us to ask questions concerning the long-term histo-
ries of primate populations. By using high-throughput
methods to resequence multiple segments of the nuclear
genome of small numbers of representatives of diﬀer-
ent populations, we seek to understand when and how
populations diverge, how they remain separate in the
presence of gene ﬂow, and the social, ecological and de-
mographic factors that ultimately underly the patterns
observed.
Candidates with experience in relevant molecular bi-
ology lab techniques, population genetics theory, and
skills in genetic data analysis are encouraged to ap-
ply. The student will be a member of the genetics
group of the primatology department of the Max Planck
Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (see http:/-
/www.eva.mpg.de/primat/ﬁles/genetics.htm ) and re-
ceive a degree through the Leipzig School of Human
Origins, an International Max Planck Research School
of the University of Leipzig and the Max Planck In-
stitute for Evolutionary Anthropology (see http://-
www.leipzig-school.eva.mpg.de/start.html ). Students
are supported by fellowships.
Applicants will ideally already have a masters degree
in a relevant subject (e.g., Biochemistry, Molecular Bi-
ology, Genetics, Anthropology). Alternatively, an ex-
cellent bachelors degree (e.g., ﬁrst, with high honors)may be acceptable but please enquire prior to apply-
ing. Candidates should also have good organizational
skills, be interested in behavioral ecology, genetics and
evolution, be able to work independently as well as in
a team and enjoy working in an interdisciplinary envi-
ronment.
The application deadline is January 31, 2009 and the
student should begin by September 1, 2009. Applica-
tions should be ﬁled following the instructions at http:/-

Further details of the research programme:
Cows, starlings and Campylobacter in New Zealand:
unifying phylogeny, genealogy and epidemiology to gain
insight into pathogen evolution
Summary: The introduction of European wildlife has
had a devastating eﬀect on New Zealands ﬂora and
fauna. Yet these historical events, coupled with the im-
portation of domestic livestock, have provided us with a
unique opportunity to study the evolution of a globally
important human pathogen: Campylobacter. Using an-
alytical tools recently developed by our research team,
together with detailed sequencing studies, we aim to ex-
ploit the newly-discovered host speciﬁcity of C. jejuni
and C. coli strains and the well-characterised historical
separation of both NZ and European host and bacterial
populations, to improve our understanding of Campy-
lobacter species evolution. We have unprecedented ac-
cess to isolates, and their multilocus gene sequences,
cultured from humans, domestic animals and wildlife in
NZ and Europe - and will gather additional isolates and
more detailed sequence data from NZ. We will discover
how often, and how much, genetic material is exchanged
between natural populations; how important recombi-
nation is relative to mutation for the emergence of new
strains; and in which host species these events are most
likely to occur. Ultimately we can learn how and why
C. jejuni emerged to become such a prominent human
pathogen; anticipate further evolution and restrict the
emergence and spread of new strains.

PopulationGenomics
PhD Student Position - Population Genomics
A 3-year PhD student position in Population Genomics
is available in the newly formed lab of Dr. Oskar
Hallatschek at the Max-Planck-Institute for Dynam-
ics and Self-Organization in G¨ ottingen. The student
will join a young and interactive research group in evo-
lutionary dynamics and biophysics, including theoreti-
cians and experimentalists. We cultivate an interna-
tional atmosphere and the everyday working language
is English. The Max-Planck-Institute for Dynamics
and Self-Organization is located close to the center of
the medieval town of G¨ ottingen. More information
about the group is available on the web at: http://-
www.fas.harvard.edu/˜ohallats/ )
The goal of the P.h.D. project is to quantify genetic
footprints of natural selection and demographic revo-
lutions, and how they can be disentangled from one
another: Kimura’s neutral theory dominated the ﬁeld
of population genetics as long as sequence data was a
rare commodity. The recent years of whole genome se-
quencing revealed quite surprisingly that standard neu-
tral models rarely explain observed polymorphism data
well. Many researchers take these deviations as ubiq-
uitous signatures of acting natural selection. However,
although standard neutral models seem to be a poor
null model, the new interpretation in terms of natural
selection is far from straight forward. Most models of
natural selection make even more stringent assumptions
than neutral models, such as panmixia, demographic
equilibrium and negligible epistatic interactions. These
simpliﬁcations could well have dropped the baby with
the bath water.
The situation clearly indicates that genetic data min-
ing is ahead of our theoretical understanding of the
how molecular evolution works (“population genetics
was much more fun in lack of genetic data”, Whitlock).
What could replace the neutral theory as a null model
of molecular evolution? The P.h.D. student will join our
group eﬀort to develop a new null model, which could
well dependent on the species. Speciﬁcally, he or she
will search for new sensible ways to disentangle natural
selection from a typically unsteady demographic his-
tory. The project will pay attention to spatial aspects of
evolution, epistatic selection and the previously unseentypes and amounts of data of the coming years. Prior
experience in population genetics modeling, molecular
evolution or comparative genomics is helpful but not
necessary.
The appointment will be on a temporary basis for a
maximum of 4 years. The gross salary starts at ap-
proximately 1400,- per month depending on age and
experience (TV¨ oD 13/2, Stufe 1). The student will
be enrolled in the G¨ ottingen Graduate School for Neu-
rosciences and Molecular Biosciences (GGNB, http://-
www.ggnb.uni-goettingen.de/ ). Applicants should have
a master’s degree or equivalent in biology, math,
physics, or related ﬁelds. If you hold an excellent
BSc (1st class honors) please contact us about pos-
sible accession. German is not required but interna-
tional students will be oﬀered opportunities to take

Munich 2 DinoﬂagellateEvolution
Job announcement
The Departments of Palaeontology (FU Berlin), Sys-
tematic Botany (LMU Munich), Historical Geology
& Palaeontology (University Bremen), and the Mu-
seum of Natural History (Berlin) invites applications
for 2 Ph.D. Studentships in Systematics, Evolution
and Biogeography of Dinoﬂagellates Salary: approx.
29,000 gross per annum (employment according to Ger-
man BAT IIa/2 / E13/2), funded by the Deutsche
Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, project title: “Evolu-
tion of calcareous dinoﬂagellates producing benthic
cysts”, Ref. KE 322/36-1) Duration: 2009-2011 (2 x 36
months) Starting date: January 1st, 2009, or as soonDecember 1, 2008 EvolDir 17
as possible thereafter
Essentials We are looking for two motivated candidates
holding a Masters degree (or equivalent) in a relevant
subject. One Ph.D. project requires expertise in molec-
ular systematics (DNA extractions, PCR, sequencing,
bioinformatics; biochemists are also welcome to apply),
and the other project involves research, for which light
and electron microscopy (SEM/TEM) skills are essen-
tial. Both Ph.D. projects will be located at the Ludwig-
Maximilians-University in Munich, and successful can-
didates will demonstrate interest in the ﬁelds of taxon-
omy and systematics, broader questions in evolutionary
biology, and biogeography and molecular clock studies.
Good communication skills, the ability to work inde-
pendently in an interdisciplinary team, and the willing-
ness to conduct ﬁeldwork in Europe and South America
are essential. A working knowledge of English, and pos-
sibly also Spanish, is desirable.
Job duties The two Ph.D. students will interact closely,
combining molecular and morphological approaches to
expand the currently fragmentary knowledge about the
extant diversity of calcareous dinoﬂagellates. Such mi-
cro algae belonging to the Alveolata are excellently
preserved in the fossil record and have received in-
creased attention over the past three decades as regards
their use in biostratigraphy, climate, and environmen-
tal reconstruction. Supposed “living fossils” have been
described, but not been brought into culture so far.
The project will thus include ﬁeldwork to expand the
World’s largest living culture collection of calacareous
dinoﬂagellates held at Bremen. Detailed morphological
and anatomical investigations of the diﬀerent life cycle
stages will result in additional characters for phyloge-
netic analyses and will provide a deeper understanding
of morphology and function of coccoid stages in calcare-
ous dinoﬂagellates. Multi-gene phylogenetic trees will
be set in a temporal context by fossil calibrations or
constraints, and you will address questions about the
timing and setting of divergence events as well as the
association of divergence events with habitat require-
ments and the establishment of new ecological niches.
Applications should be sent to Prof. Dr. Hel-
mut Keupp, Freie Universit¨ at Berlin, Geologische
Wissenschaften, Fachrichtung Pal¨ aontologie, Malteser-
strasse 74-100, D - 122 49 Berlin, and include: 1) a
cover letter outlining relevant background and work ex-
perience, 2) a full curriculum vitae, including a list of
publications and copies of certiﬁcates, 3) names and
addresses of two referees. The Freie Universit¨ at Berlin
supports gender equality and particularly encourages
women to apply. Equally qualiﬁed, severely handi-
capped applicants will be given preference.For informal enquiries, please contact Dr. Marc
Gottschling (gottschling@biologie.uni-muenchen.de).

1st, 2008.

SAfrica PopGenInvasionBiology
Postgraduate Bursaries in Ecological Genetics of Inva-
sive Species. Several opportunities at Honours, MSc
and PhD level at the Centre for Invasion Biology, Stel-
lenbosch University Please note: these bursaries are
only for South Africans.
The C*I*B is a dynamic, internationally leading agency
which undertakes research to reduce the rate and im-
pacts of biological invasions. We are looking for several
postgraduate students interested in ecological genetics
and molecular ecology, to form part of a major 5 year
collaborative project with the Working for Water Pro-
gramme and the University of Adelaide / Herbarium of
South Australia.
Project details: The projects form part of a broader
project to improve our understanding and management
of alien plant invasions using molecular techniques.
Component 1 focuses on the phylogeography of Aus-
tralian plants invasive in South Africa (more than 20
species of wattles and hakeas). We want to understand
how, why, and from where exactly plants were intro-
duced. This information is of direct applied beneﬁt
to classical biological control eﬀorts. Population ge-
netics analysis using microsdatellite markers will also
be used to compare levels of genetic diversity; the oc-
curance of admixture and hybridization; studying forevidence of local adaptation; and potentially exploring
epigenetic diﬀerences; we will address one of the most
exciting and topical questions in biology: how quickly
can species evolve under new selection pressures? In
the second component we will extend the analysis to
include insect and fungi introduced for classical biolog-
ical control. Finally, in component 3, we want to com-
bine mathematical models and ecological studies with
analyses of gene ﬂow to understand dispersal distances
and invasion pathways of major invasive alien species
in South Africa.
The projects are ﬂexible, allowing students to focus on
issues that interest them and, after preliminary analy-
sis, would identify additional research questions.
Requirements: Hons: excellent marks at undergradu-
ate level * a keen interest in molecular ecology * excel-
lent communication skills (speaking, reading, writing)
in English and sound mathematical literacy * ability
to work independently and take initiative * an inter-
est of some of the main issues in conservation * ability
to work within a team * willingness to work extended
hours when required * knowledge of basic laboratory
etiquette * willingness to travel overseas for training.
MSc (in addition to the above): experience in working
in a molecular lab
PhD (in addition to the above): evidence of producing
work published or publishable in international journals
* presentations given at national and/or international
meetings.
Recommendations: Experience in working with mi-
crosatellite markers * experience of working with and
analysing population genetic data * experience of eco-
logical ﬁeld-work * papers published in international
journals * an interest in botany, ecology and/or evo-
lutionary biology/genetics. Closing date: 30 Novem-
ber 2008 to start January 2009. Enquiries: Dr John

in the musculoskeletal system to accommodate a
pelagic lifestyle. These include the evolution of bone
loss to increase buoyancy, and craniofacial adaptations
to accommodate shits in diet and foraging strategies.
Up to four years of funding (via research assistantship)
are available to study the genetic and developmental
mechanisms that underlie these skeletal adaptations.20 EvolDir December 1, 2008
The successful applicant will interact with other stu-
dents in the lab (undergraduate, graduate, and post-

number of systems including zebraﬁsh, African cichlids
and Antarctic iceﬁsh. The approach of the lab is to
integrate studies in a laboratory model (i.e., zebraﬁsh)
and natural populations (i.e., cichlids) to understand
the evolution of animal form and function. Methods
of study include comparative embryology, developmen-
tal and molecular genetics, quantitative genetics, and

ChemoautotrophicEvolution
Could you please post the following ad for a PhD po-
sition (research topic: evolution of chemoautotrophic
symbioses)?
Thank you very much for your help!
Best wishes, Sharmishtha
The newly formed junior research group “Geomicro-
biology and Biosignatures in the Deep Biosphere”
headed by Dr. Sharmishtha Dattagupta in the
Courant Research Centre Geobiology at the University
of G¨ ottingen invites applications for one Ph.D. position
The CRC Geobiology (Coordinator: Prof. Reitner,
Department of Geobiology; www.uni-goettingen.de/-
crcc) is one of ﬁve interdisciplinary research cen-
tres ( www.uni-goettingen.de/crc ) recently established
by the University of G¨ ottingen as part of its institu-
tional strategy “Tradition - Innovation - Autonomy”.
Our research group focuses on the microbial ecology
and evolution of chemoautotrophic ecosystems, with
emphasis on animal-bacterial symbioses. Ecosystems
sustained by chemoautotrophy are found at deep-sea
hydrothermal vents, cold seeps and some sulﬁde-rich
limestone caves. Terrestrial sulﬁde-rich caves are easier
to access than deep-sea habitats and oﬀer an excellent
opportunity to study the interplay between geochem-
istry, microbes and macrofauna. Our primary research
ﬁeld site is the actively forming sulﬁde-rich Frasassi
cave complex of central Italy that hosts an ecosystem
sustained entirely by microbial chemoautotrophy. We
have recently discovered a symbiosis between a Frasassi-
endemic amphipod and ﬁlamentous chemoautotrophic
bacteria. Future projects will address the potential
beneﬁts of the bacterial symbionts to the amphipod
host, and examine the evolution of this symbiosis.24 EvolDir December 1, 2008
Candidates should hold either a Master’s degree or
a German “Diplom” in Molecular Biology, Microbial
Ecology or Geomicrobiology. Fieldwork experience is
desired. The working language of the group is English,
and applicants from abroad are encouraged to apply.
The University of G¨ ottingen seeks to increase the par-
ticipation of women in areas in which they are currently
underrepresented and therefore explicitly urges women
to apply. Disabled persons with equivalent aptitude
will be favored.
The position is initially available for two years starting
immediately and can be extended to three years fol-
lowing favorable reviews. Salary is in accordance with
the German state regulated public service salary scale
(TV-L 13).
For informal enquiries please contact sdattag@uni-

UHelsinki ParastoidEvolution
Open position for one evolutionary PhD student in
one of two possible projects (A) PARASTOID META-
COMMUNITY EVOLUTION or (B) PARASITOID
BEHAVIORAL EVOLUTION. Apply for one or the
other.
A) PARASTOID METACOMMUNITY
EVOLUTION- This is work based on the meta-
community of insects associated with the Glanville
fritillary butterﬂy (Melitaea cinxia) in the ˚Aland
islands, Finland. Your research will address patterns
of metacommunity structure and mechanisms behind
them, such as (1) the prediction that food-chain length
decreases with habitat fragmentation because the
adverse eﬀects of habitat fragmentation increase with
trophic level, and (2) the landscape level eﬀects of
indirect interactions between butterﬂies mediate by
parasitoids. The applicant must have a strong interest
in community evolution and a Masters Degree or equiv-
alent. For information about the research system see:
http://www.helsinki.ﬁ/science/metapop/metacom/-
research/metacom structure.htm B) PARASITOID
BEHAVIORAL EVOLUTION- There is a history of
conceptually linking behaviour of parasitoids with
resulting predator-prey population dynamics. So far
biologists know about what parasitoids do over short
time-scales foraging in small areas, but this is only part
of the picture. The student would work on an ongoing
project using the parasitoids of the Glanville fritillary
(Melitaea cinxia) in ˚Aland, Finland to understand
evolutionary relevant parasitoid foraging behaviour.
This includes study of spatial learning, competition
among adult female parasitoids, and measures of
foraging success in a natural landscape. The applicant
must have a strong interest in and experience with
behavioural evolution, and a Masters Degree or equiv-
alent. For information about the research system see:
http://www.helsinki.ﬁ/science/metapop/metacom/-
research/parasitoid foraging.htm The successful
applicant will be a PhD student in the metacommunity
evolution group, a subgroup of the MetapopulationResearch Group, at the University of Helsinki ( http:/-
/www.helsinki.ﬁ/science/metapop/ ). We are a Centre
of Excellence supported by the Academy of Finland.
We have an international research environment with
opportunities for mixing among evolutionists, molecu-
lar biologists and mathematicians. The position is for
completion of a PhD within four years, and includes
a salary of about 2,300 /month plus social beneﬁts.
Please send your application and any enquiries to
Saskya van Nouhuys (saskya@cornell.edu). Include a
short CV, a one page explanation of your motivation
and suitability for the project (be clear about which
project), and the e-mail addresses of three researchers
who can document that you are self-motivated and
can do productive independent work. Consideration
of applications will begin mid November 2008 and
continue until the position is ﬁlled. The position could
start as soon as January 2009.

Department of Evolution, Genomics and Systematics,
Uppsala University, Sweden, invites applications for
Doctoral student position in molecular evolution with
the focus on genome evolution of microbial eukaryotes
The doctoral student will be part of a com-
parative genomics project on the protist
group diplomonads under the supervision ofDecember 1, 2008 EvolDir 29
Dr. Jan Andersson (jan.andersson@ebc.uu.se
<mailto:jan.andersson@ebc.uu.se >). The information
below can be found at http://www.personalavd.uu.se/-
ledigaplatser/2693dorand eng.htm . Project descrip-
tion:* * Diplomonads are a group of anaerobic
microbial eukaryotes that have two cell nuclei. The
human intestinal parasite /Giardia lamblia /belongs
to diplomonads, but there are also free-living members
of the group. The project will study how genetic
information is transferred between the two nuclei,
among diplomonads, and between diplomonads and
other organisms, over evolutionary time. The aim is
an understanding how these and other evolutionary
processes interact with various lifestyles within the
group.
* *
*Comparative genomic methods will be used on data
generated with next-generation sequencing methods
from a diversity of diplomonads. The project will have
a strong bioinformatic component, but also molecular
biology methods may be included. The results from
this project are relevant for epidemiological studies, al-
though the main focus will be on a deeper understand-
ing of genome evolution of microbial eukaryotes. *
The position will be within a creative international re-
search environment at the Department of Genomics,
Evolution and Systematics ( http://www.egs.uu.se/ )
at Uppsala University (http://www.uu.se/en/). The
project is in collaboration with research groups in Swe-
den and Canada.

*Qualiﬁcations:* We are looking for an excellent,
strongly motivated candidate with a keen interest in
microbial evolution. The PhD position requires a Mas-
ter of Science, or equivalent, in bioinformatics, micro-
biology, molecular biology, or in a ﬁeld which is rele-
vant for the topic of the project. *Your application*

car (the mainland ±), but with exclusively auto- pol-
linating populations of B. occultum also occurring in
La Runion, Mauritius, and the Comores. We will em-
ploy population genetic surveys of cpDNA haplotype
sequence variation, single-copy nuclear genes, and nu-
clear microsatellites at both the intra- and interspeciﬁc
level, complemented by detailed ﬂoral-trait measure-
ments and pollination experiments, to determine the
reproductive, ﬂoral-morphological and population ge-
netic consequences associated with remote oceanic is-
land colonization of B. occultum.
The ideal applicant has a strong interest in plant evo-30 EvolDir December 1, 2008
lution and a strong background in population genet-
ics and statistical analyses. Laboratory experience is
required and experiences in pollination experimental
work would be an advantage. An MSc, diploma de-
gree or equivalent in Botany, Genetics or Evolutionary
Biology is required. Fluent English is a must.
Funding is for three years by the Austrian National Sci-
ence Fund (FWF). The University of Salzburg ( http:/-

PopulationComparativeGenomics
We wish to identify talented candidates for a tenure-
track Assistant Professor position in Population and/or
Comparative Genomics in the Department of Biologi-
cal Statistics and Computational Biology (BSCB) at
Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. We are seeking to
ﬁll this position with a creative individual who is fo-
cusing on developing and applying statistically rig-
orous methods to large-scale data analysis in popu-
lation and/or comparative genomics. The success-
ful candidate will join an outstanding and interac-
tive group of faculty at Cornell with core interests in
population, comparative and evolutionary genomics in-
cluding Andy Clark, Carlos Bustamante, Adam Sie-
pel, Jason Mezey, Rick Durrett, Brian Lazzaro, Dan
Barbash, Mariana Wolfner, Ed Buckler, Steve Kreso-
vich, Steve Tanksley, Susan McCouch, Zhenglong Gu,
Kerry Shaw, Matt Hare, Irby Lovette, Rick Harrison,
Nelson Hairston, Jr., Kelly Zamudio, Monica Geber,
Michael Stanhope, Ruth Ley, Steve Zinder, Nate Sut-
ter, Bryan Danforth, Jeﬀ Doyle, myself, and oth-
ers. An advertisement, which is attached, appeared
in the Oct. 10, 2008 issue of Science describing this
position together with three other faculty searches
in related areas ( http://scjobs.sciencemag.org/jobs/-
default.aspx?job=31709 ). These other positions in-
clude Assistant/Associate Professor in the genomics
approaches to the study of gene regulation (includ-
ing comparative and evolutionary approaches), Assis-
tant/Associate Professor of cellular systems biology,
and two positions (open rank) in computational biol-
ogy/genomics.
The Department of Biological Statistics and Compu-
tational Biology is dedicated to the application of sta-
tistical, computational, and mathematical approaches
to problems in modern biology. The department has
broad strengths in statistics and computational biology,
including comparative, evolutionary, quantitative, and
population genomics, Bayesian and computationally in-
tensive statistics, and machine learning. The depart-
ment occupies a key position at the interface between
the quantitative and biological sciences at Cornell and
oﬀers rich opportunities for collaborations with other
investigators on the Ithaca campus, and at the Weill
Cornell Medical College in New York City. Some of
the research areas with particularly high potential forcollaboration include: human genetics, agricultural ge-
nomics, canine genomics and other aspects of veterinary
medicine, and evolutionary genomics of diverse organ-
isms. Members of the department are physically lo-
cated in one of three adjacent buildings that also house
the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, En-
tomology, and the Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular
Biology. The Departments of Ecology and Evolution-
ary Biology, and of Neurobiology and Behavior, are in
an adjacent (connected) building, with faculty being
place most closely to relevant colleagues in these other
departments.
This is a very exciting time at Cornell as the University
has speciﬁcally targeted comparative and population
genomics for expansion, and has just launched a new
Cornell Center for Comparative and Population Ge-
nomics ( http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Oct08/-
PopGenCtr.kr.html ). The University is making a con-
certed investment in these and other interdisciplinary
studies that bridge existing strengths in the University
(seehttp://www.cornell.edu/lifesciences/ ).
Please bring this great opportunity to the attention of
outstanding junior scientists your group and depart-
ment. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate
to contact me at CFA1@cornell.edu.

tween physiology, evolution and ecology. Candidates
must hold a PhD diploma in animal ecology, popula-
tion ecology, behavioral ecology or evolutionary ecol-
ogy and have solid skills in ecology and animal physi-
ology, and some basic knowledge in French. Those of

Ancient Naturalists from Asia
Dear EvolDir Members,
I am preparing a course on the History of Natural His-
tory, from ancient times to the 21st century. Unfor-
tunately, I haven’t been able to ﬁnd any leads on An-
cient Accounts of Natural History from Asia, particu-
larly names of signiﬁcant or noteworthy individuals in
ancient Eastern societies. This is in sharp contrast with
the vast amount of information on Greek and Roman
philosophers/naturalists.
If anyone can suggest speciﬁc references or provide
names of prominent Ancient Naturalists from Asia, it
will be greatly appreciated. Also welcome is infor-
mation regarding any knowledge of remarkable, yet-
relatively unknown naturalists that I should investigate.
Best regards,

Arlequin mismatch question
Hi all
I have a question about the calculation of the mismatch
distribution using the Arlequin 3.11 software package.
In their article, Schneider and Excoﬃer (1999), strongly
suggest to take into account rate heterogeneity and nu-
cleotide mutation correction models when calculating a
mismatch distribution. Especially in the case where the
parameters Tau and Theta is going to be used and the
validity of inferring a demographic expansion is tested.
However, in Arlequin it seems that the only distance op-
tion available is a Pairwise diﬀerence with no gamma
correction.
Although, I have seen articles that say that they used
correction models such as K2P and modiﬁed alpha
values when calculating mismatch distributions in Ar-56 EvolDir December 1, 2008
lequin.
Is there a way that one can incorporate these correc-
tions in your data using Arlequin?
Any suggestions will be much appreciated
Thank you

Basic tasks
Dear all,
I am doing some basic population genetics analysis and
I need to perform some basic tasks automatically to
speed data processing. I need softwares to do automat-
ically the following tasks:
a) to output unique haplotypes, sorting haplotype fre-
quencies per population b) a spreadsheet software that
allows the exclusion of a population from a pairwise ma-
trix, reorganizing cells of the remaining comparisons.
And also allows the inversion of a pairwise matrix to
put it as a mirror of another pairwise matrix (so I will
have two diﬀerent indices analyzed for the same popu-
lations in a square matrix) c) A software that output
the diﬀerentiation index Snn (Hudson, 2000) from sev-
eral pairwise comparison in a single matrix (I can do
pair by pair in DNAsp)
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks

BioTek Precision XS Micropipettor
answers
Recently I inquired about experience anyone has had
with the Biotek Precision XS automatic pipettor. Theoriginal inquiry and two informative responses are
posted below. I have since ﬁddled with our instrument
considerably, and have a few follow up points to oﬀer
as well. Generally, it seems as though this instrument
can handle volumes down to 2ul, but is more accurate
with volumes >= 5ul (don’t count on using it to set
up real-time PCR assays). Spotting small volumes on
the bottom of wells is diﬃcult, but it can be done. The
ﬂexibility of the platform is not quite as advertised, but
is adequate. For instance, we had to purchase several
very expensive adapters to ﬁt our plates and microfuge
tubes. We also had to purchase separate adapters in
order to install our plates on the rear row of docking
stations. With all this said, we are pleased (overall)
with the performance of the instrument so far. Thanks
to all who responded.

Hi Joel,
We have a diﬀerent BioTek model, the Precision 2000.
We’ve had it for about 6 years and it’s still going strong.
I have only had to replace the o-rings. The only thing
we use it for is pooling pcrs for multiplexing on gels
or capillary injections (96 well microplate format). It is
very useful and quick for that application–and we could
probably use it for other post-pcr apps as well–but its
use is somewhat limited by the minimum pipetting vol-
ume of 3 ul. We use it to transfer volumes of 3-10 ul,
and although it does okay with 3, it seems to be more
accurate/uniform in the 5-10 ul range. Hope this helps,
and let me know if you have any other questions.

Joel, We bought a Precision last year, and I was not im-
pressed with the initial communication with the com-
pany in getting us set up with the necessary plate and
tip holders. It took us several months to get it set up
properly, and they were quite disorganized. In the end
they continued to help until we got things sorted out,
and we have been using the instrument only for makingDecember 1, 2008 EvolDir 57
replicate plates for genotyping or DNA quantiﬁcation.
Unfortunately, we didn’t buy the XS model, which I
now think we could use, so we only have 8-channel ca-
pability. I have found that the minimum reliable vol-
ume for transferring to empty plates is about 4 µl, but
at that volume it seems to work very well. What I like
about the instrument is that it is quite easy to program
once you understand the basics, and once programs are
set up, it is very reliable. We haven’t had any problems
with our standard programs, and we use the instrument
fairly often. Assuming you have all of the parts you
need for your applications, I think the instrument is a
good value, and very ﬂexible. One other think I just re-
membered. We tried to use a variety of other tips, and
ended up buying the tips from BioTech because others
didn’t work well with it. If you already have a brand
you want to use. make sure to test them out on the
robot ﬁrst.
I hope this helps. If you get good responses about us-
ing the instrument for the applications you mentioned
in your Evoldir posting, I would appreciate it if you
would forward them to me, or post them on Evoldir.

Dear colleagues,
I posted a request on evoldir a few months ago trying
to ﬁnd out if anyone working on decapod crustaceans
is aware of primers for intron-containing nuclear genes
other than those for Elonation Factor 1-alpha (which
seem to work only for insectsˆ a). Although the response
was negative, Paul Sunnucks pointed out some univer-
sal coelomate primers for low-copy nuclear genes (Jar-
man et al. 2002).
Those didn’t work for our species either, but we got mo-
tivated to design our own primers for one of the genes
in that paper, the Adenine Nucleotide Transporter
(ANT). Although our primers were designed using pe-
naeids and are not universal (they don’t seem to work
for anomurans and freshwater crayﬁsh), they amplify
PCR product in a number of other decapod groups,
including the Achelata, Brachyura, Caridea, Dendro-
branchiata, Eryonoidea and Thalassinoidea. PCR
products tend to have a good concentration, single
bands were obtained in all cases, and both primers are
also good for sequencing. Most sequences contained an
intron, which was more than 834 bp long in one of the
crabs, and no shorter than 150 bp in most other species.
The region ampliﬁed also contains a large chunk of
exon, so this may be useful for multi-locus phylogenetic
studies, in addition to the usual mtDNA+18S/28S/H3
combination.
The primer note is (almost) in press: Teske PR, Be-
heregaray LB. Inron-spanning primers for the ampliﬁ-
cation of the nuclear ANT gene in decapod crustaceans,
Molecular Ecology Resources. If you’d like a pdf, please
contact me at Peter.Teske@bio.mq.edu.au
We’ve only tested these in decapods, but I’d be very
interested to hear if anyone gets them to work in other
crustacean orders. And of course I’m still be very keen
to ﬁnd out if anyone is aware of other primers for crus-
tacean introns.

Evanno Method Structure answers
I have been away from lab for a week, but below I ﬁ-
nally summarize the replies that I received to my evoldir
query, which was:
I have a question regarding the delta k method of in-
ferring the most likely k value in STRUCTURE. This
method is discussed in the paper Evanno G, S Reg-
naut, J Goudet 2005. Detecting the number of clusters
of individuals using the software STRUCTURE: a sim-
ulation study. Mol Ecol 14: 2611-2620.
Obviously, there is no way to validate k =1. But since
k = 2 is based on prior values (in part) generated for k
=1, is it also invalid? The reason I ask is that I often
get the highest delta k value for k = 2, which for my
pops makes little sense. Intuitively, k = 2 would seem to
not be able to be validated by Evanno et al.’s method,
but I need some reinforcement for this assessment! Any
input will be appreciated.
First oﬀ, a number of evoldir readers aﬃrmed my con-
cern - they, too, have received the highest delta k values
for k = 2, which they either found not very informa-
tive or peculiar. Below, reader responses are bracketed
in quotation marks. My further comments are without
quotes.
“There’s no reason I can think of why evaluating at
K=2 would be invalid. You may be ﬁnding that K=2
is most probable because you have hierarchical struc-
ture in your data set – the Evanno method ﬁnds the
uppermost level of structure in a given data set. You
may want to subset your data based on the results of
the individual assignments for K=2, and run STRUC-
TURE on those subsets, and evaluate them with the
Evanno method. See Coulon et al 2008 (Mol Ecol 17,
1685-1701) for more details.”
This did occur to me, i.e., that STRUCTURE was cap-
turing the highest level of hierarchy, thus it would be
appropriate to then test each cluster independently for
substructure. However, I noted that the vast majority
of my original 45 populations were being assigned to
cluster 1 with high probabilities, and only one pop was
almost completely admixed. What disturbed me, how-ever, was that one subpopulation from a cluster of three
very closely related populations from a previous pub-
lished paper, was being assigned to the second cluster
in this mega-analysis.
“A more statistically motivated alternative to the Delta
K method of evanno is the DIC. We have implemented
it in TESS (similar to structure but using spatial co-
ordinates in addition to the genetic data). You might
have a look at it
TESS 2.0: http://www-timc.imag.fr/Eric.Durand/-
soft.html.”
My doctoral student is in fact using TESS. Meanwhile,
realizing that a minority of my 45 pops were at HWE,
and a many were in fact inbred, I began using In-
Struct, which drops STRUCTURE’s HWE assumption
and also estimates inbreeding in each inferred popu-
lation. InStruct also implements the DIC (Deviance
Information Criteria) to assess the optimal k value. In
fact ﬁnds k =7 to be most likely. Interestingly, after the
large peak of delta k at 2, 6 and 7 have next highest
scores and are statistically equal.
“In your case it might be better to follow the common
sense approach advocated in the STRUCTURE man-
ual, which as far as I remember is to pick the K where
the likelihood, L(K), stops making large improvements,
and to combine this with prior biological knowledge.
The delta K method is designed to ﬁnd this K objec-
tively by calculating something close to the maximum
retardation, delta K [or abs(L”(K))], of the L(K) vs K
curve. In cases where the answer isn’t obvious from
the L(K) plot (it’s always worth looking at the plots),
then I’d guess that the delta K plot will also be hard
to interpret.
“For example, if the ”true“ K is 1, then the delta K plot
should be approximately ﬂat because there should be
no K around which L(K) rises substantially from K-1
to K and then rises much less from K to K+1 (this is
the signal that max delta K is trying to ﬁnd). Of course
the delta K plot won’t be exactly ﬂat, but if there is no
clear spike (e.g. the spike at K=5 in Fig. 2D of Evanno
et al.) then max delta K will reﬂect noise. Perhaps this
is what you have? It would be nice to have an objective
way to tell signal from noise, but for now it’s best to
include a large dose of common sense (but see the PLoS
Genetics paper below).
”Other cases where the answer might not be obvi-
ous are where the model of discrete admixed popula-
tions doesn’t represent very well the true population, or
where the number of loci or samples is too small. Imag-
ine a situation with no prior information on population
membership where there is clear structure reﬂected inDecember 1, 2008 EvolDir 59
the L(K) plot, but it isn’t obvious which of a range of K
is best. In this case the delta K method at least has the
advantage of objectivity, although reporting a plausible
range of K might make more sense than giving a point
estimate.
“One thing I don’t understand about the delta K
method is the motivation

Evanno Method Structure answers 2
I neglected to include Jerome Goudot’s response to my
query on the Evanno delta k method last week, and
include as well, a more recent reponse.
“I see no reason why our method would not work for
K=2. It does in computer simulations (this is the case
for our ”hybrid zone“ scenario, Fig 1C and Fig 4, G,
H of our paper). It is based on the rate of change of
the slope in Ln(K), and this can be estimated for K=2.
What do you mean when you say K=2 makes little sense
for your data? It might be that you have only one clus-
ter, but the nearest best solution is K=2? What does
Ln(K) says? I should also emphasize that our method
is ad hoc, and needs to be complemented by looking at
how well individuals are assigned to the diﬀerent clus-
ters. If all or most individuals at K=2 share ancestry
in the two clusters, then K=2 is likely wrong.”
“have you tried running AMOVAs on your dataset us-
ing the K - values Structure suggests? In my case I
indeed had the highest Fst values when using K = 2.”

Yet another informative reply to my query on estimat-
ing k in STRUCTURE:
“I hesitated to add what I felt was an obvious answer
to your K problem - but it seems those responsible for a
solution are being shy. Within one run, STRUCTURE,
and its relatives, do not compare diﬀerent values of K
- instead the user is left to do this posthoc. From an
inference point of view, this would be why section 4 of
the structure manual (Estimating K) says: ’In our pa-
per describing this program, we pointed out that this
issue should be treated with care for two reasons: (1)
it is computationally diﬃcult to obtain accurate esti-
mates of Pr(X |K), and our method merely provides an
ad hoc approximation....’
”A rigorous (non-adhoc) inference approach to estimat-
ing K would, within each run, compare not only a)
diﬀerent memberships of individuals in clusters and b)
diﬀerent genetic compositions of clusters but also c) dif-
ferent numbers of clusters.
“STRUCTURE does (a) and (b), but not (c). That
is STRUCTURE does not mix over K. Its authors are
correct that mixing over K is computationally diﬃcult
BUT there are at least two model-based Bayesian clus-
tering algorithms which do mix over K, and thus are in
principle better suited for estimating K.
”1) Partition, by Dawson and Belkir - an approach
which was conceived independently of, and at the same
time as, STRUCTURE, but (perhaps unfortunately)
has not received the same attention.
“2) The more recent Geneland, by Gilles Goullot -
which not only mixes over K, but also allows geographic
information to aid the clustering of individuals.
”For those who have no geographic information in their
dataset, or do see it as relevant, the spatial component
of Geneland can be switched oﬀ, leaving us with a clus-
tering algorithm that mixes over K.
“I think it is great that you have provoked discussion of
K estimation, but I don’t think that discussion should
play out solely within the framework of posthoc ban-
dages on methods which are poorly adapted to the es-
timation in question.”

The animal genomics research community has used Phil
Green’s Cri-Map program for the best part pf the last
15 years to compute linkage maps. The program will do
everything that you ask (and in fact quite a bit more,
since it will also construct IBD maps of the chromo-
somes of all individuals). It won’t handle polyploids
and it doesn’t have a fancy GUI (it is command line
driven), but it will handle very large pedigrees and large
numbers of loci. We have just used the program to
constuct a genetic map of over 12,000 SNPs scored in
10,000 individuals.
You can get it here.

Measuring selection coeﬃcients
Dear Evoldir
I want to estimate selection coeﬃcients from a longitu-
dinal series of diploid genotype frequencies. The gene
in question encodes insecticide resistance so selection is
relatively intense.
I intend to use max. likelihood to ﬁt initial allele fre-
quency, selection coeﬃcient and dominance (i.e. P(0),
s and h in standard terminology). Given these three
parameters we can predict genotype frequencies at any
given time point and use the multinomial distribution
to get LL of obtaining the observed number of the three
genotypes.
So I have two questions
(1) Is this a sensible way of doing it, or are there hidden
pitfalls and/or is there a better way? (2) Has anyone
done it before and published the method so we can cite
it? It seems like it should be a standard type of analysis
but we haven’t been able to track a previous one down
yet. (3) Better still, is there a public access programme
that we can download? If not, we’ll write our own and
make it available.
Thanks in advance for any responses.

Nuclear and mitochondrial
phylogeny
Dear Evoldir members,
I am working with mitochondrial and nuclear sequences
(cytochrome b and the intron b-ﬁbrinogen 5) to try to
delineate population structure and I am trying to do
a phylogenetic tree with these two markers. But I am
experiencing some problems with how to make an in-
put for some programs (I am currently working with
MrBayes and PHYML). For each individual, I have se-
quences of both nuclear and mitochondrial markers.
Should I analyze these two markers as two datasets?
How can I do it?
Should I concatenate them and consider as a single se-
quence and run a modeltest to determinate the best
substitution model?
In a recent paper, Cabanne et al. (2008) concatenated
the nuclear and mitochondrial sequences, and used the
IUPAC ambiguity code for the polymorphic sites. Since
I know the phase of my nuclear sequences, is there a way
that I can use it in the phylogeny with the mitochon-
drial data?
Any comments would be of great help.

Outsourcing microsat development
Dear all,
I have a query about outsourcing the development of
microsatellite markers. I need to have markers devel-
oped for two species for a reasonable price. Does anyone
have a company to recommend?
Any help will be highly appreciated!Best regards,

Outsourcing microsat development
answers
Hi all,
A couple of weeks ago I posted a question about com-
panies to outsource microsat development to. I want
to thank everyone who took the time to respond. It
was very helpful! Here is a list of the diﬀerent options
I found:
Cornell University The Evolutionary Genetics Core Fa-
cility (EGCF) at Cornell University is oﬀering construc-
tion and screening of genomic DNA libraries for mi-
crosatellite loci, as a service to the evolutionary commu-
nity. Total cost for this service is USD 4300 per library,
which includes all construction, screening, and guaran-
teed discovery of 32 unique clones containing SSRs.
For details, see the EvolDir post from Oct 2, or contact
Steve Bogdanowicz smb31@cornell.edu, 607-254-4297,
254-4286.
Ecogenics Oﬀers any chosen stage of microsat develop-
ment. Construction of a genomic library with at least
50 SSR containing colonies costs EUR 7140. Devel-
opment of a set of ﬁve markers with at least four al-
leles per locus in 15 unrelated individuals costs EUR
10 540, and additional markers are EUR 680 each.
www.ecogenics.ch Genetic ID Services, GIS Constructs
genomic libraries with 350 to 700 bp fragments, en-
riched for diﬀerent microsatellite motifs in each of
four libraries, in E. coli, with sequences that con-
ﬁrm the presence of at least 50% microsatellites in
at least two of the libraries. Includes 100 sequences
with primer design. Costs USD 10 000 for one species
and a small discount is oﬀered if more than one li-
brary is ordered. http://www.genetic-id-services.com/-
library.htm University of Georgia Oﬀers construc-
tion of genomic libraries ( >25% positive clones) or
complete microsat marker development. The price
for constructing a genomic library is USD 5750. If
screening for polymorphism is also ordered, the priceDecember 1, 2008 EvolDir 65
is in total USD 10 000 (testing 20 primer pairs on
15 individuals). Substantial discounts are oﬀered if
more than one species is ordered (for example, two
species cost USD 17 000). http://www.uga.edu/srel/-

Parallel evolution speciation studies
Dear all,
The parallel evolution of phenotypic traits is common
whenever independent populations are exposed to sim-
ilar ecological conditions. This is a well know phe-
nomenon for diﬀerent forms/morphs/ecotypes of stick-
lebacks, lake whiteﬁsh, arctic charr and Periwinkles
(Littorina). I plan to write an article on this sub-
ject and I would be interested to ﬁnd many more
examples that ﬁts into the concept “parallel evolu-
tion/speciation” in animals. A search on ISI generates
over 10.000 hits and I ask your help to ﬁnd key articles,
especially for taxa than I have not already mentioned

prevalence
I am looking for advice on how to pool larger specimens.
I am looking to obtain an estimate of parasite preva-
lence from juvenile blue crabs ranging from 1-30mm in
carapace width. The reason for pooling these samples
is to cut back on the cost of processing a large number
of juvenile crabs (100s) from a large number of sites
(~30). I have found literature describing the pooling of
smaller organisms, like mosquitoes and copepods, but
very little concerning larger organisms. I should also
add that I do not have any prevalence data for juve-
niles for the sites these juveniles were collected from;
however, there is some adult crab prevalence informa-
tion ( ~15% in nearby areas) and previously published
studies have shown that the prevalence for this parasite
is higher in juveniles (as high as 60%).
I will be extracting these pooled samples with a Qiagen
DNeasy Kit. I am looking for advice on where to begin-
how much tissue from each crab do I pool? How many
crabs do I pool into a single sample?

Problems microsatellite
development
Dear all,
I am currently in the process of developing enriched mi-
crosatellite libraries for a number of diﬀerent species.
But have encountered signiﬁcant problems at the stage
of selecting bacteria which contain inserts (i.e. blue
white colour selection). The enrichment procedure fol-
lows the protocol as detailed by Kijas et al 1994 (refer-
ence below). Extremely brieﬂy - once fragments have
been preselected for speciﬁc microsatellite repeat mo-66 EvolDir December 1, 2008
tifs, they are digested with restriction enzymes and lig-
ated into a speciﬁcally cleaved vector (pBluescript plas-
mid) and transformed into XL-2 blue supercompetent
E.coli cells, then grown on bacteriological agar pH 7.0
containing ampicillan, IPTG and X-gal (all according
to manufacturers speciﬁcations).
Transformations work ﬁne with plenty of colonies for
the control pUC-18 plasmid (blue colonies only) and for
the microsatellite libraries (blue and white colonies). I
decided to do a quick test to determine if ligations were
successful and to determine the size of inserts. Surpris-
ingly many of the white colonies (positives) DO NOT
contain any insert at all. Even more surprisingly many
of the blue colonies (negatives) actually do contain in-
serts. More extensive testing revealed that as many
blue colonies contain inserts as do white colonies.
The digested vector has been used with great success
in the past (I am using an aliquot of an existing tried
and tested stock). I have redone ligations and trans-
formations several times, each time producing a similar
result. I would be very grateful for comments or sug-
gestions regarding solutions to this problem, and I am
interested to know if anyone else has experienced simi-
lar things.
Many thanks in advance

Reducing microsatellite stutter
paper answers
Hello EvolDir members,
I sent the email below in October in the hopes of ﬁnd-
ing the complete reference to the described paper. I
thank everybody who took the time to respond. I have
not had any success in ﬁnding the reference, though
I’ve had interest from others who would also like the
reference to the described paper. I was also emailed
suggested reading material, which is listed below. The
technique in the Brownstein et al. (1996) paper is use-ful to remove stutter caused by + A artifacts, though
I believe the stutter in my case is not caused by this. I
found the last paper listed particularly useful as a guide
in reducing stutter thought to be caused by strand slip-
page, though the described novel technique of reducing
denaturation temperature was unsuccessful in the few
dinucleotide loci I attempted. I’d be interested to hear
if anybody has had success (or no success) with using a
reduced denaturation temperature to decrease stutter,
particularly for dinucleotides as the paper only tested
trinucleotides.

Hello EvolDir members, I’m trying to ﬁnd (with no
luck) the original Biotechniques paper which describes
the technique of using greatly abbreviated PCR times
(e.g. 2/2/8 s) at each step to decrease microsatellite
stutter. This technique was described in the response
of Andrew DeWoody in 2006 (see below for quoted re-
sponse) to an EvolDir member that asked about how
to decrease stutter. I do not know the complete ref-
erence of this paper, and as Andrew read the paper a
while ago he is also unsure of the reference though he
thinks the paper might be about hymenopterans. Does
anybody know the full reference of this paper or (pref-
erentially) can they email the paper as an attachment
to catherine.attard@students.mq.edu.au?
Many thanks and kind regards,
Catherine
EvolDir response: “You might try greatly abbreviated
times at each step in PCR (e.g., 2 sec denaturation,
2 sec annealing, 8 sec extension). The original paper
describing this was published in Biotechniques about 6
or 7 years ago; see also the attached reprint. [We had
cited the Biotechniques paper in the bass reprint, but
the citation was ultimately cut due to strict page limitsDecember 1, 2008 EvolDir 67
in PRS.] In my experience, the approach either works
very well or fails completely (on a locus by locus basis).
If you get ampliﬁcations, the stutter is usually greatly
reduced. DeWoody et al. (2000) Proc. R. Soc. Lond.
B 267:2431-2437.”

Scat DNA in DMSO
Hi,
I am actually involved in a project that aims to pro-
vide non invasive genetic approaches (species, sex and
individual identiﬁcation) for the long term monitoring
of jaguar (Panthera onca) populations in tropical ar-
eas. We are actually using a highly eﬃcient proto-
col of DNA extraction from scats conserved with Silica
gel beads, but we recently got some samples preserved
with DMSO. I wonder whether someone has experience
with this kind of storage and whether extraction pro-
tocols are available, that allow to get both suﬃcient
quality/quantity DNA for microsatellites and mtDNA
typing.
I will be very grateful to get any kind of information.
Thank you very much for your collaboration.
All the best.

Sharing 454
To any and all who may be interested:
A group of collaborating researchers at Stanford Uni-
versity are looking for partners to share in the cost of
a titanium 454 sequencing run. We are looking to pur-
chase 1/8-1/4 of a full plate, and would like to ﬁnd fel-low researchers who are excited about the new technol-
ogy, but would like a lower-cost “test-run” before com-
mitting the $12,000-$20,000 for a full plate. A 1/4 plate
will likely cost $3,000 - $5,000 (depending on choice of
sequencing facility), and should return ~250,000 reads,
with an average length of ~400-500 bp, for a total of
100-125 MB of sequence. Few sequencing facilities of-
fer partial runs at partial costs, and those that do can
not guarantee rapid service unless there is enough in-
terest in partial runs to ﬁll a full run. We would like to
ﬁnd enough partners to ﬁll a full plate within the next
month or so. If you are interested please respond to
Tom Oliver, (toliver@stanford.edu), and I can answer
any questions you have.
Thanks,

Software SeqVis1 4
An updated version of SeqVis 1.4 can be obtained from:
http://www.bio.usyd.edu.au/jermiin/SeqVis/-
index.htm The new version ﬁxes a number of
bugs kindly reported by some users. The bugs include
incompatibility with some of the newer operative
systems and reading sequences stored in the FASTA
format.
Below is brief description of SeqVis:
Most phylogenetic methods assume that the sequences
have evolved under homogeneous, stationary and re-
versible conditions. Compositional heterogeneity in
data intended for studies of phylogeny suggests that
the data did not evolve under these conditions. SeqVis,
a Java application for analysis of nucleotide content,
reads sequence alignments in several formats and plots
the nucleotide content in a tetrahedron. Once plotted,
outliers can be identiﬁed, thus allowing for decisions on
the applicability of the data for phylogenetic analysis.
The visualization of compositional heterogeneity is fur-
ther supported by a matched-pairs test of homogeneity.

Software TESS
A new version of TESS by Eric Durand is available on-line at:
http://www-timc.imag.fr/Olivier.Francois/tess.html
orhttp://www-timc.imag.fr/Eric.Durand/soft.html
TESS 2.0 implements a Bayesian clustering algorithm
for the inference of spatial population genetic structure.
The new features are:
- an improved admixture model using spatial autocor-
relation - inclusion of geographic distance and kinship -
possibility to export to CLUMPP format directly - pos-
sibility to start from a NJ tree - computation of model
choice indices: DIC - better GUI
Speciﬁcally, the new admixture model uses a CAR (con-
ditional autoregression) model based on the Delaunay
tessellation. The new version allows the user to weight
the TESS spatial network by inverse geographic great
circle distance or kinskip. This new model could be
considered more reliable than the TESS 1.x admix-
ture model which was based on an approximation of
the model implemented in STRUCTURE. The without-
admixture model is unchanged.

TajimasD analysis answers
Dear All,
I have posted the following question on evoldir:
Hi to everybody, I have a question about the Tajima’s
D analysis implemented in DNAsp: in some papers (for
instance Wheat et al. 2006, Mes et al. 2006) I found
that the authors use the tajima’s D analysis consider-
ing only the synonymous sites, but I don’t really ﬁnd
the way to do it. Is there someone who knows how to
do it? All answers would be very helpful.
I would like to thank all that answered me, it was really
helpful. Here are all the responses I received, hope it
will be helpful for someone else!
Again, thanks to everybody!
#####
Dear Erica, please note that in my methods section70 EvolDir December 1, 2008
(Wheat et al. 2006) I state that I used two programs
for DNA summary statistic calculations. DNAsp did
not do syn site Taj D calculations then, and I don’t
think it does it now- which is a bit of a pain. How-
ever, the other program, Proseq, does do syn site Taj
D calculations- but be careful, the new program version
is a bit tricky to use. I strongly recommend estimating
your TajD calculations using more than one program if
you are going to use the point and click GUI programs.
This will ensure you are getting the numbers you really
want. Cheers,
Chris
#########
This really is surprisingly diﬃcult to do, and the
work-around seems to spread slowly by word of
mouth! (1) Export the synonymous polymorphic sites
as a new ﬁle: generate >polymorphic/variable sites
dataﬁle >only synonymous (2) Open the new ﬁle, and
do the Taj D analysis on that [If you are then using
coalescent simulations with intermediate levels of re-
combination, remember to use the rate for the whole
lenght of the gene, not just the subset you’ve gener-
ated!] Good luck! Darren
####
Hello Erica, I believe that the way to do it is to cre-
ated an input ﬁle with only synonymous SNPs. In this
case you will calculate TD only considering synonymous
sites. Best, Luis
###
Hi, Under the Data menu, go to Remove Positions, then
select which positions to include/exclude. Every anal-
ysis you do after that will only be performed on the
positions you have decided to keep. I hope that helps.

########
Dear Erica: We’ve done it a lot. I ﬁnd that looking at
synonymous and nonsynonymous sites separately with
Tajima’s D-like statistics is very revealing. I actually
use the ratio of D to the absolute value of its theoretical
minimum. Thie latter statistic (Q) has the advantage
of not being dependent on sample size (unlike D) and
therefore comparable across data sets. We have done
this mostly using custom-made software, some of which
we are gettiong into a user-friendly form for publication
in the not too distant future. Austin Hughes Some ref-

Undergraduate Core Curriculum
In Northern California and Nevada, we are currently
suﬀering a shortage of well-trained organismal biolo-
gists who go on to do applied work and perhaps a mas-
ter’s degree. Ideally, this student would have a strong
undergraduate education with an emphasis in their tax-
onomic group of choice and advanced classes in evolu-
tion and ecology. In discussions with many colleagues,
it is clear that there are two very diﬀerent view points
on why this is the case and how to ﬁx the problem.
Some of us maintain that the loss of students in organis-
mal biology, borne out by the diﬀerences in numbers of
organismal biologists trained and jobs available (for ex-
ample, over 100% undertraining of botanists obtained
from data on # of degrees granted vs. www.bls.gov <
http://www.bls.gov/ >and other job sites) is due to
the “over-integration” of undergraduate biology pro-
grams and the loss of the ﬁrst year traditional biol-
ogy sequence of molecular biology, botany, and zool-
ogy. We maintain that this “traditional” sequence does
not negate integration and provides an introduction
that simulates the upper division organismally-based
courses.
Others maintain that the courses in the “traditional”
freshman track are archaic and other methods for re-
tention in organismal biology tracts are needed, or that
this tract simply needs to suﬀer a natural death.
I would appreciate hearing about the experiences of
other universities on this issue. If you reply to me oﬀ-
list, I will compile the results and post them.
Thank you,

HarvardU PopulationGenetics
Postdoc opportunity in population genetics and evolu-
tion (posted November 14, 2008)
We are searching for a motivated post-graduate re-
searcher to join our group. The focus of the position
will be on using population genetic approaches to learn
about history and evolution.
The successful candidate will have a strong statistical
background, as well as in interest in human history and
evolution. While a background in population genetics
and bioinformatics would be a strength, such a back-
ground is not necessary. Possible projects are:
(i) Estimating the dates of population mixtures using
admixture linkage disequilibrium. In African Ameri-
cans and Latinos, the extent of chunks of contiguous
African, European and Native American ancestry are
typically about 10-20 centimorgans, which shows that
these populations have typically been mixing for 5-10
generations. Our goal will be to extend these methods
to accurately estimate the dates of mixture events that
are hundreds of generations old.
(ii) Inferring relationships of human populations using
allele frequency data. No investigator believes that
a simple phylogenetic tree (with populations at the
leaves) is an adequate description of human history.
Nevertheless, such trees are frequently published. The
goal will be to develop a novel suite of analytic tools
that extend the phylogenetic tree framework. To han-
dle the presence of gene ﬂow between populations, the
project will examine mathematical models (admixture
graphs) that allow a rich, but still parsimonious de-
scription of genetic relationships among populations,
and develop a procedure to ﬁt the genetic data. We
will analyze genome-wide data from both SNP arrays
and deep resequencing, using publicly available data
and data we collect in our own lab to address the ques-
tions of highest interest.
(iii) Test whether hybridization occurred during
human-chimpanzee speciation. We recently published
a study (Patterson et al. Nature 2006) in which we
compared about 10 million bases of the genome in hu-
mans, chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans and macaques
to show that the history of human-chimpanzee split-
ting was complex . We hypothesized that an expla-
nation was hybridization during the speciation of hu-mans and chimpanzees. While several other groups
have conﬁrmed the main observations, no one has sug-
gested an alternative explanation for the discrepant
patterns between chromosome X and the autosomes.
This project will involve rigorously testing this hypoth-
esis using whole-genome alignments and novel analysis
methods.
(iv) Systematically explore whether hybridization com-
monly occurs during speciation. The most interesting
result of analysis of human, chimpanzee and gorilla dif-
ferences was the inference that speciation may not al-
ways occur in a simple way: in “allopatry”. If instead
we use genomic data to harken back in time to the pe-
riod millions of years ago when successful speciations
occurred, we might ﬁnd that many speciations were
complex, as reﬂected by a diverse and structured popu-
lation ancestral to the split, and unusual patterns com-
paring chromosome X to the autosomes. This project
will use genomic methods to study a large number of
ancient speciations, and determine what pattern of spe-
ciation is most common. For this project, we will mine
publicly available data and data sets that we collect in
our own lab.
The position will be jointly supervised by Drs. David
Reich and Nick Patterson, and will involve work at
both the Department of Genetics at Harvard and
the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. Further
information about our laboratory and a list of re-
cent papers can be found at our web page: http://-

Postdoctoral Fellowship
POPULATION GENETICS / EPIDEMIOLOGY /
MODELING: We are searching for a postdoc who has
a strong theoretical or empirical background in popu-
lation ecology, population genetics, and/or epidemiol-
ogy to work on an NIH- and Gates Foundation-funded
project aimed at decreasing the mosquito-vectored hu-
man disease, dengue fever.
QUALIFICATIONS: Although substantial experience
with building simulation models is desirable, we will
consider applicants who have little experience with
model building, but have a strong record of picking up
new quantitative skills. In depth knowledge of statisti-
cal methods is a plus.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The project is aimed at
assessing the potential as well as risks associated
with using selﬁsh genetic elements to drive genes into
mosquito populations that render them incapable of
transmitting dengue fever or malaria. We are build-
ing and testing stochastic, spatially explicit, simulation
models that link insect population dynamics, disease
epidemiology, and population genetics in a way that can
contribute to improving strategies for releasing trans-
genic mosquitoes to reduce the incidence of human dis-
ease. Sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis of
model outputs will be critical in assessing reliability.
We are also building simple spatial and non-spatial,
deterministic models as heuristic tools for better un-
derstanding basic principles, but we are not looking for
applicants who are only interested in working with sim-
ple, generic models.
The fellowship is for 2 years (starting as soon as pos-
sible) but could be extended for a third year pending
additional funding. In addition to working on model
development and analysis, the person in this position
will collaborate in an interdisciplinary group composed
of mosquito ecologists, disease epidemiologists, molecu-
lar biologists, biomathematicians, ethicists, and scien-
tists from disease-endemic countries, in eﬀorts to de-
velop novel transgenic strategies for disease reduction.
The person in this position will work with the PIs (Fred
Gould & Alun Lloyd) and another postdoc in organiz-
ing a workshop to teach other researchers how to use
the models.
There are opportunities for some empirical research (if
desired), and for interactions with other members of the
lab who are working on other ecological and evolution-
ary research projects. NCSU is developing an interdis-
ciplinary graduate program in Genetic Pest Manage-
ment, so there are likely to be teaching opportunities(if desired). http://www.ncsu.edu/project/gpm/ An

the project are: to make discoveries concerning the ge-
netic contributions to non-pathological cognitive ageing
in humans; to conduct a genome-wide association study
of long-term normal cognitive ageing in two UK sam-
ples; and to conduct replication studies on new, large
independent samples from the same centres. The hu-
man cohorts involved in the study have unique data on
cognitive ageing over several decades. The work will
be in collaboration with the project investigators who
have expertise in cognitive ability and ageing, genet-
ics, and statistical genetics. The appointee will be sit-
uated within the Department of Psychology and the

Postdoctoral Fellow (Fixed-term)
DEPARTMENT OF ANATOMY AND STRUC-
TURAL BIOLOGY OTAGO SCHOOL OF MEDICAL
SCIENCES
Microsatellites are abundant, highly variable, repeated
DNA sequences that are regarded as the most versa-
tile genetic markers yet discovered. They are a corner-
stone of the current biological revolution and are used
in gene mapping, in DNA forensic work, and as pop-
ulation markers. Conclusions drawn from such studies
in many cases depend critically on assumptions about
how microsatellites evolve. Despite its importance, our
understanding of microsatellite evolution remains sur-
prisingly sketchy. Current models of microsatellite evo-
lution are overly simplistic and almost certainly incor-
rect, potentially leading to widespread data misinter-
pretation. In particular, genetic recombination, whilst
known to be the major generator of genomic variability,
is widely regarded as a minor contributor to microsatel-
lite evolution, if indeed it contributes at all. Here we
seek to quantify the extent and nature of microsatellite
mutation, and, for the ﬁrst time, explicitly examine the
role of sexual recombination in generating microsatel-
lite variability, using near identical yeast strains that
variously do and do not engage in sex, and thus re-
combination. If, as we suspect, recombination is an
important force in microsatellite evolution, evolution-
ary models will need to be modiﬁed, potentially with
far-reaching consequences for how we analyse and in-
terpret microsatellite data and for our understanding
of trinucleotide repeat disorders, such as Fragile X and
Huntington1s disease.
Applications are invited from postdoctoral candidates80 EvolDir December 1, 2008
who have experience in molecular and population ge-
netics. The Department oﬀers opportunity to work in
studies using leading edge DNA technologies. The suc-
cessful candidate will have skills in molecular genetic

UFlorida MolecularMarkers Dec8-12Molecular Markers Workshop
ICBR’s Genetic Analysis Laboratory and Education
Core at the University of Florida are oﬀering its
Molecular Markers: Tools for Developing Enriched Mi-
crosatellite Libraries workshop on December 8-12, 2008.
This popular workshop will take participants through
the steps of a tried and true enrichment protocol which
includes restriction enzymes, size selection, PCR, frag-
ment selection with probes, and other techniques com-
monly used in a molecular laboratory using DNA they
bring. Participants will learn about newer technology
being used to develop microsatellite libraries, such as
FLX 454 sequencing, gain some experience designing
primers, analyzing data, and will have the potential of
leaving with an enriched library.
The cost of this workshop is: $500.00 for all registered
UF students, faculty and staﬀ. $900.00 for all others.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it88 EvolDir December 1, 2008
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
