Second International Symposium on the Emergence
and Evolution of Linguistic Communication (EELC’05)
at the AISB’05 Convention 12-15 April 2005, Hatﬁeld

seh Fitch* (University of St. Andrews, Scotland) (* =

Scope of the Symposium
The renewed scientiﬁc interest in the emergence and
evolution of linguistic communication has become one
of the most important research issues in Artiﬁcial Intel-
ligence and Cognitive Science. The EELC’05 Sympo-
sium will focus on the latest empirical and modelling re-
search on the evolutionary factors that aﬀect the acqui-
sition, self-organization and origins of linguistic com-
munication systems and their precursors. This consid-
ers both language-speciﬁc abilities (e.g. speech, seman-
tics and syntax) and other cognitive, sensorimotor and
social abilities (e.g. category learning, action and em-
bodiment, social networks). Key questions relate to thethe emergence of: symbol grounding; deixis, gesture,
and reference; predication; negation; syntactic cate-
gories; and compositionality; among other issues in the
context of embodied, social interaction and evolution.
This is a ﬁeld characterized by a highly interdisciplinary
and multi-methodological approach. It beneﬁts from
the contribution of researchers from wide ranging disci-
plines such as linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, an-
thropology and computer science. The methodologies
adopted cover a wide range of approaches, from animal
and human experiments, to brain studies and to compu-
tational and robotic modelling of linguistic behaviour.
For example, computational models of language evolu-
tion and emergence involve artiﬁcial intelligence meth-
ods (e.g. artiﬁcial neural networks, evolutionary com-
putation, rule-based systems) and techniques for the
simulation of behaviour (artiﬁcial life, multi-agent sys-
tems, adaptive behaviour and robotics). The sympo-
sium will create the opportunity for the many of most
inﬂuential in the ﬁeld to present their latest research
and to discuss the agenda for future studies.
The use of computational models for simulating the
evolution of language has been one of the main contrib-
utors to the renewed interest in language evolution re-
search. In fact, up to 10 years ago, very few researchers
were directly interested in the origins and evolution of
language and publications on new language evolution
studies were uncommon. This was partly the result
of the famous ban in the 19th century by the Soci´ et´ e
Linguistique de Paris on research and publication on
language origins to quell rampant, unfounded specula-
tion on the topic. The development of the ﬁrst lan-
guage evolution models in the early 90s permitted to
deal with some of the main diﬃculties in such a sci-
entiﬁc ﬁeld. Theories of language origins and evolu-
tion not only were diﬃcult to test empirically but theyOctober 1, 2004 EvolDir 3
tended to be stated in vague and general terms and
were unable to generate detailed empirical predictions.
This has been partially due to the problem of the ob-
jective scarcity of empirical evidence. It is this very
problematic aspect of the study of language evolution
which computer simulations can help us to overcome.
Computer simulations are theories of the empirical phe-
nomena that are simulated (Cangelosi & Parisi 2002).
Simulations are a novel way to express theories in sci-
ence. They are scientiﬁc theories expressed as computer
programs. The program incorporates a set of hypothe-
ses on the causes, mechanisms, and processes underly-
ing the simulated phenomena and, when the program
runs in the computer, the results of the simulations are
the empirical predictions derived from the theory in-
corporated in the simulation. All this contributes to
the development of a new approach to the study of the
origins and evolution of language.

Friday 19th November, 2004, The Royal Society, Lon-
don
A walk from the wild side: the genetics of domestica-
tion of livestock and crops
The livestock and crop species currently used by hu-
mans around the world are remarkably distinct from
the wild animals and plants from which they are de-
rived. This divergence occured much faster than “nat-
ural evolution”. How did this happen,what genes were
involved, and what changes might we expect in the fu-
ture? What will be the relative contributions of tradi-
tional breeding and genetic engineering? This meeting
will assemble a panel of expert speakers to answer the
questions “what happened during domestication?” and
“what can we expect next?”.

Dec16-18
Dear Colleague:
This is to invite you to attend a National Academy
of Sciences Sackler Colloquium on Systematics and
the Origin of Species. On Ernst Mayr’s 100th An-
niversary, to be held December 16-18, 2004 at the
Beckman Center of the National Academies of Sci-
ences and Engineering in Irvine, California. The
following information, and Preliminary Program and
Registration Forms, can be accessed at the NAS
web site. http://www4.nationalacademies.org/nas/-
nashome.nsf/urllinks/NAS-58MTTC?OpenDocument
The Colloquium will celebrate the 100th birthday of
the eminent evolutionist Ernst Mayr and the 62nd an-6 EvolDir October 1, 2004
niversary of the publication of his Systematics and the
Origin of Species (1942), one of the four books often
considered as the foundations of the modern theory of
evolution. The Colloquium will explore the main top-
ics in Mayr’s book and examine the same (and related)
issues in the light of current science, although the focus
will be on speciation, rather than on systematics.
Attendance at the Colloquium is limited to 250 reg-
istered individuals. To facilitate the participation of
younger scientists, we request that you extend this in-
vitation to interested graduate students and postdocs.
The NAS has provided funds to supplement the ex-
penses of participating graduate students and postdocs
up to $100 for hotel costs and $150 for air travel. A
maximum of 100 awards will be granted, with priority
based exclusively on the order in which requests (ac-
companied by the registration fee) are received. Noti-
ﬁcation of the award will be made shortly after receiv-
ing the application but the awards will be paid after
the Colloquium, upon documentation of qualifying ex-
penses. The Travel/Hotel Award Form is attached.
Registrations will be accepted only when the registra-
tion fee is included and in the order in which they are
received. The registration fee is $350, which includes
the cost of meals, reception, and banquet. However, an
early registration fee of $250 (also including meals, re-
ception, and banquet) is available to those posting their
registration by November 1, 2004. And, a reduced all-
inclusive registration fee of $100 is oﬀered to Graduate
Students and Postdocs who register by November 1st.
A block of hotel rooms has been reserved at the Hy-
att Newporter Resort at a discount rate of $106, plus
tax, for a single or a double. Hotel reservations must
be made when registering (see Registration Form for
more information). Hotel reservations must be made by
November 24, 2004. Please do not call the hotel directly
for room reservations, as they can only accept reserva-
tions through the NAS. Shuttle bus service between the
hotel and the Beckman Center will be provided free of
charge at speciﬁed times.

RESEARCH ASSISTANT and Professor, MNHN,
Paris,
If you are interested by position of researchers at the
MNHN of Paris (Maˆ ıtres de conf´ erences and Professors)
you must know that the procedure is rather long and
that one needs ﬁrst of all is registered on a list of qual-
iﬁcation, without knowing the positions which will be
opened.
Thus I remind to you that the procedure of inscription
on the lists of qualiﬁcation to the functions of Professors
and Maˆ ıtres de conf´ erences of the Mus´ eum National
d’Histoire Naturelle is open since September 10 and un-
til October 19, 2004 on Internet site of the Minist` ere de
l’Education Nationale, http://www.education.gouv.fr,
heading “ les enseignants du sup´ erieur ” then Antares.
(sorry but all is in French in the website!).
I invite all the researchers potentially interested to be
registered on this list. About mid of December who are
registered now will receive a letter which will require
of them to send a ﬁle (CV + 2 to 5 publications+ )
to two reviewers. Those which will be accepted could
be candidates on the positions which will be published

MaxPlanckInst ZerbraFish
Two PhD positions are available at the Max Planck
Institute for Ornithology in Seewiesen (near Munich,
Germany) starting around December 2004 to study the
evolutionary signiﬁcance of variation in sexual person-
ality traits in a captive zebra ﬁnch population.
We seek highly motivated individuals who share our
fascination with the diversity of personalities found in
animals and who have a background or strong interest
in some of the following ﬁelds: behavioural ecology, evo-
lution, ethology, psychology, quantitative genetics, and
endocrinology. The positions are funded by the DFG in
the framework of a newly established Emmy-Noether
Research Group “Individual diﬀerences in sexual be-
haviour: proximate mechanisms and adaptive value”.We study the inheritance and ﬁtness consequences of
individual diﬀerences in male sex drive and aggressive-
ness as well as female promiscuity and mating prefer-
ences. We use a quantitative genetic approach (ani-
mal models) to disentangle the diﬀerent sources (ad-
ditive genetic, maternal, rearing environment) poten-
tially causing the variation in sexual personality traits.
We will also obtain measures of lifetime reproductive
success under aviary conditions to test for frequency-
dependent selection of personality types and for the
adaptive signiﬁcance of maternal programming of oﬀ-
spring personalities.
The work will involve: breeding and cross-fostering
zebra ﬁnches, behavioural testing and analysis of
videos (using “The Observer”), observation of birds in
aviaries, parentage analysis (using microsatellite mark-
ers), and quantitative genetic analyses (using “REML-
VCE”). However, enthusiasm, reliability and commit-
ment will be more important than experience in those
tasks listed. The two PhD students will be expected
to work independently as well as contributing to the
research of the group.
Initial appointment will be for two years with a possi-
ble extension for a further two years subject to research
progress. Payment is based on the German BAT IIa/2
federal public service scale. The Max Planck Society is
an equal opportunity employer and encourages disabled
persons to apply. It also aims at increasing the num-
ber of women in ﬁelds where they are underrepresented,
and therefore encourages them to apply.
Applications should include a concise statement of
research interests and work experiences relevant to
the project, curriculum vitae and contact details
for 2-3 academic references. Please send your ap-
plication as a single ﬁle (Word-doc or pdf) be-
fore October 8, 2004 (but late applications may
be considered) to <mailto:forstmeier@orn.mpg.de >

Munich FuncMorphology
Munich, Germany: PhD-position in Physiology / Func-
tional Morphology
We invite applications for 1 PhD position in a DFG ﬁ-
nanced research project Living at the Extremes Feed-
ing and Fasting, Resting and Exercise in the Arctic.
The project will be located at the Department of Biol-
ogy II of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich,
Germany
The project aims to characterize morphological and
physiological plasticity in working Greenland sled dogs.
Because they experience extreme seasonal ﬂuctuations
in environmental temperature, coupled with changes in
food intake and activity levels, these dogs are a good
model for studies of plasticity. We will use non-invasive
repeated measurements on the same dogs over several
years, of oxygen consumption, heart rate, food intake
and fecal and urinary output, to estimating whole-body metabolic rate and energy balance. We will as-
sess seasonal and exercise-related changes in muscle
and intestine size using B-image ultrasonography, and
cardiac output using Doppler-ultrasonography. Endo-
scopic biopsies will enable us to monitor concomitant
changes in stomach and intestine mucosal ultrastruc-
ture. Percutaneous muscle biopsies will provide ma-
terial for ﬁber type characterization, quantiﬁcation of
intramuscular lipid stores and enzyme activities, and
muscle capillarity. We will use external data loggers to
measure heart rate and peripheral arterial oxygen satu-
ration continuously in dogs exercising in the ﬁeld, while
recording running speed and elevation proﬁles using a
global positioning system. Fieldwork will be conducted
in Germany and at the Danish Arctic Station at Qe-
qertarsuaq, on Disko Island oﬀ the southwestern coast
of Greenland.
The project will be jointly supervised by Prof. Dr.
Matthias Starck, Department of Biology II, Ludwig-
Maximilians University, and Dr. Sue Jackson, De-
partment of Botany and Zoology, University of Stel-
lenbosch, South Africa.
Requirements: Degree in Biology (MA, MSc, or equiv-
alent degree); good knowledge of physiological and his-
tochemical techniques and statistics; excellent English
language skills.
Deadline for applications: 15 Oct. 2004. The position
is available for 2 years.
In case of equivalent qualiﬁcations, disabled people are
preferentially employed.

UBern Cichlids
Two PhD positions in Ecological Genetics of Speciation
and Hybridization in African cichlid ﬁsh
Two 3-years PhD projects are available in the research
group of Ole Seehausen in both the Aquatic Ecology10 EvolDir October 1, 2004
section of the Institute of Zoology, University of Bern,
Switzerland and the Limnological Research Centre of
the EAWAG, Kastanienbaum, Switzerland, to investi-
gate using African cichlid ﬁsh, (a) the role of diﬀerent
types of selection during speciation-with-geneﬂow, (b)
the role of hybridization in generating adaptive novelty,.
One of the least well understood problems in evolution-
ary biology and biodiversity research is why some or-
ganisms have undergone massive speciation and adap-
tive diversiﬁcation in very short time, whereas many
others, often closely related and superﬁcially similar,
have not. Variation in the propensity to speciation with
geneﬂow, driven by ecological processes that exert dis-
ruptive or diversifying selection is now receiving a lot of
attention, and an intensive debate centres on possible
causes of disruptive selection during such speciation.
Diverging mating preferences are assumed in many of
the models, and in most speciation scenarios for cich-
lids. However, it is unclear whether such divergence
of mating preferences is recruited by selection resulting
from competition for ecological resources or by selec-
tion resulting from competition for mating opportuni-
ties, followed by ecological character displacement.
One PhD project (’speciation project’) will aim at de-
veloping experimental tests of predictions made by al-
ternative speciation models with regard to the emer-
gence of gene associations and genetic linkage groups
comprising alternative sets of genes. We will use hy-
bridizing morphs or incipient species of Lake Victoria
cichlids to (i) subject diﬀerent classes of traits to tests
of disruptive selection, and (ii) to identify chromosomal
linkage groups containing “speciation traits” by associ-
ation scans with AFLP markers.
Another unresolved problem associated with the rapid
emergence of adaptive diversity is the source of ge-
netic variation that endows some lineages with unusu-
ally high rates of phenotypic evolution. One idea is
that hybridization in novel environments between ge-
netically well diﬀerentiated lineages endows resulting
hybrid populations with large variation in quantita-
tive traits that allow them subsequently to radiate in
response to diversifying selection. The second PhD
project (’hybridisation project’) will use experimental
ecological genetics to test predictions of this hypothesis.
This involves experimental quantiﬁcation of morpholog-
ical diversity generated by interspeciﬁc hybridization
and experimental parameterisation of endogenous and
ecological hybrid ﬁtness and functional hybrid diversity
in relation to genomic and ecological distinctiveness of
parental species. We will work with cichlid ﬁsh species
that we have recently identiﬁed as likely ancestors of
several African radiations.
We are looking for enthusiastic, dedicated students witha master’s degree or equivalent (e.g. Diplom) in Biology
and background in evolutionary theory and population
genetics or quantitative morphometrics. The speciation
project will involve a large amount of work in our molec-
ular laboratory, extracting DNA, PCR, fragment sepa-
ration on automated sequencers, genetic data analysis,
but considerable amounts of morphometric and ecolog-
ical work, ﬁeldwork on Lake Victoria, and possibly ex-
perimental ﬁsh breeding too. The hybridization project
involves breeding and hybridization experiments in our
new purpose built ﬁsh house on Lake Lucerne, quantiﬁ-
cation of shape using geometric morphometrics, quan-
tiﬁcation of colour and behaviour, molecular genetic
work using AFLPs, and some ﬁeldwork to collect ci-
chlids. Some experience in the generation and analysis
of molecular genetic data will be required for the specia-
tion project, and will be advantagous for the hybridiza-
tion project too. Experience with quantitative mor-
phometric data analysis and quantitative genetics will
be advantageous, as will be experience with handling
and maintaining life ﬁsh. The successful applicants
will be able to work independently, as well as in small
teams. They will collaborate closely with postdoc-
toral researchers in our research group. Further, they
will interact with the large community of population
biologists, ecologists and geneticists at the Institute
of Zoology ( http://www.zoology.unibe.ch/index.php )
and the population and system ecologists at the
Limnological Research Centre ( http://www.eawag.ch/-
research e/kastanienbaum/e index.html ). Besides re-
search, PhD students are expected to contribute to
undergraduate teaching and supervision (teaching load
not exceeding 10 percent of working time). Salaries will

We are looking for a Ph.D. candidate to work on:
Ecological and genetic change in a biological control
agent following introduction to a new region.
(PI’s: Russell H. Messing, Mark G. Wright, Ania M.
Wieczorek, George Roderick)October 1, 2004 EvolDir 11
Summary: Classical biological control has the poten-
tial to mitigate invasive arthropod problems in agro-
ecosystems, reduce insecticide use, and provide greater
crop security by combating exotic pests. However,
there is a large gap in our understanding of the eco-
logical and genetic changes that occur in natural ene-
mies AFTER they are released in a new environment.
The potential risk to non-target species inherent in
these changes makes it increasingly diﬃcult to practice
biocontrol in an eﬃcient and timely manner. In this
project we propose to analyze the behavioral, ecologi-
cal, and genetic changes, that have taken place in an in-
troduced parasitoid that has been established in Hawaii
for~100 years. Diachasmimorpha tryoni was imported
early last century from Australia to control the Mediter-
ranean fruit ﬂy, Ceratitis capitata, one of the most
economically important crop pests in the world, and
an enormous threat to U.S. agriculture. The para-
sitoid became well established on all major Hawaiian
islands, contributed signiﬁcantly to medﬂy control, but
was later documented to attack a non-target beneﬁ-
cial species, the lantana gall ﬂy (Eutreta xanthochaeta).
The basis for this host-shift and the changes that oc-
curred due to random genetic drift and natural selection
have never been examined. We will use a combination
of modern genetic (microsatellite DNA and mitochon-
drial DNA), statistical techniques and behavioral anal-
yses to examine phenotypic and genetic diﬀerentiation
of parasitoid populations on a variety of spatial scales,
including comparisons of original (source) and intro-
duced populations; populations separated on diﬀerent
islands; laboratory and ﬁeld cohorts; and populations
reproducing in nature on target- and non-target hosts.
In so doing we will increase our understanding of post-
colonization genetic change. The results will be im-
portant not only for the practice of biological control,
but also for understanding changes in invasive arthro-
pod species. Finally, the project will break new ground
in methodology for more robust long-term risk assess-
ment. To our knowledge, this will be the ﬁrst study to
examine directly genetic change in a biological control
agent associated with a shift to a non-target species.

PhD position in Grass Evolutionary Genomics
A 3-years PhD project is available in the Department
of Ecology and Evolution, Institute of Biology, Univer-
sity of Lausanne, Switzerland. The goals of this project
are to bring insights about evolution of C4 photosyn-
thesis in grasses. The C4 photosynthesis is an impor-
tant adaptive trait of plants growing in warm condi-
tions. This character has independently appeared in
several families and probably independently in several
grass subfamilies. The project will focus on the evolu-
tion of the gene family encoding Phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxylases (PEPCs) in grasses, and particularly on
the gene encoding the C4 isoform (ppc-C4). The oc-
currence of positive events, convergent evolution and
gradual selection in C4 characteristics of the ppc-C4
enzyme during the diversiﬁcation of the grass family
will be tested. A broad sample of species represen-
tative of both the diﬀerent grass sub-families and the
diﬀerent photosynthetic pathways will be used. Ppc-C4
sequence data covering gene regions containing codons
under selection will be generated for phylogenetic anal-
yses and to detect positive selection. The ppc-C4 gene
structure is expected to have been deeply modiﬁed dur-
ing grass diversiﬁcation in relation to the C4 photosyn-
thesis expression, and the organization of gene parts
(such as promoter or intron) and the gene transcription
of ppc-C4 will be analyzed in a few species and several
genotypes to investigate the evolutionary signiﬁcance
of these re-organizations on the gene expression.
We are looking for an enthusiastic student with a mas-
ter’s degree or equivalent in Biology and background
in phylogenetics and molecular genetics. The project
will involve a large amount of work in our molecular
laboratory (PCR, cloning, phylogenetic data analysis,
gene transcription analysis). The applicant will have
the opportunity to interact with our collaborators at
Kew Gardens (London) and University of Dublin, Trin-
ity College. Several stays and meetings at Kew Gardens
and Dublin are anticipated. Salaries will be accord-
ing to Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) salary
schemes.
Closing date is the 15th of October 2004. Starting
date could be as soon as the 1st of November 2004

AFLP controls
HiI am currently working on AFLP’s of butterﬂies, and
have had a lot of problems with my negative controls.
Blanks which have been through both the preselective
and selective PCR steps often have a number of peaks,
whereas controls that are only put through the selective
PCR are normally clear. I have recently been told that
this sometimes happens and not to run blanks through40 EvolDir October 1, 2004
both PCR stages. Can anybody verify this, and if so
does anyone have an explanation for why this might oc-
cur? Alternatively, I would also like to hear from people
who have clean controls!
I am dubious about eliminating negative controls from
the whole process, and would have thought that if peaks
occur in blanks than spurious bands will also be present
in samples. I am interested in any comments or sug-
gestions.
Thanks

ALFPs
Dear EvolDir members,
We’ve recently started working with AFLPs in our
lab and have been using universal ﬂourescent labeled
primers (as per Schuelke 2000).
I was curious to know whether anyone else has been us-
ing this approach with AFLPs and whether their results
have been consistent when a sample is run repeatedly.
Our problem appears mostly to be an issue of peak
quality (samples are run on an ABI 3100 Avant se-
quencer) as opposed to diﬀerential fragment ampliﬁca-
tion. Any suggestions of how to assure uniform peak
heights across runs and samples would be greatly ap-
preciated.

Bonferrnoni corrections
Dear all,
I need to perform the standard Bonferroni correction
to my data following the same procedure that FSTAT
v.2.9.3 does. They say they divide the nominal level
(usually 5%) by the number of tests that are being car-
ried out, but they don’t explain how they estimate the
number of tests. They give the following example: “In
FSTAT, with 20 samples and 10 loci, 400 tests are car-
ried out if the option ’testing, HW within sample and
locus’ is selected”. I was hoping someone would help me
to understand how this calculation is performed: is it
the nr of samples times the number of loci times 2 alle-
les...? And if I perform a HW test only within samples,
how should I perform the calculation in this situation?
I would appreciate imensely if someone could give me
a help with this.
Best regards,

DNA quantitation
Dear All, I am looking for cheap (up to
4000Euro/5000$), sensitive and easy to operate
DNA quantitation tool. As I am working very often
with samples containing small quantities of DNA thus
I need it to be rather sensitive. I also wonder what
method you use for quantitation of degradated DNA.
Any suggestions are welcome. Maciek KonopinskiDNA quantitation answers
Dear All, Three weeks ago I have posted a ques-
tion about cheap DNA quantitation system suitable
for samples with low concentrations of nucleic acids
or strongly degradated DNA. Most of you advice
Nanodrop-1000 as it needs only 2ul of DNA solution
(http://www.nanodrop.com/ ). Another solution is ﬂu-
oromotr - more sensitive but as far as I know it is more
expensive as it needs special reagents. Because nei-
ther spectrophotometrs nor ﬂuorometrs does not dis-
tinguish between degradated and good DNA it is still
necessary to check the DNA on gel. I wonder what’s
the use of buying ultrasensitive device... I was also ad-
vised to read: Hardie DC, Gregory TR, Hebert PDN.

genome quantiﬁcation by Feulgen image analysis den-
sitometry. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 50(6):735-749.
Thank all of you for your suggestions. All the answers
I received you will ﬁnd below. Best regards Maciek
———– Eppendorf/Brinkmann makes a spec that is
reasonably inexpensive (3-5$K if I remember right) but
it still requires 50ul of ﬂuid in the cuvette, and the cu-
vettes are a dollar each(or more). You can dilute your
sample of course, but it’s not as accurate that way.
But I highly recommend the Nanodrop spec. It is about
$8000US (after you include taxes) but it takes only 1 ul
of ﬂuid, and requires no cuvettes. So over the long term,
it’s much more accurate, gives a full spectrum of wave-
lengths which will help you ﬁgure out how much and
what kinds of contaminants you might have in there,
and works out to be cheaper, I think. If you do a google
search on “nanodrop 3.0” you should ﬁnd the vendor.
————– You need a ﬂuorometer (not a spec-
trophotometer). I use a smaller version (which I
am not sure they still sell) of this one: http://-
www.turnerdesigns.com/t2/instruments/td700.html —
————
My suggestion might be slightly out of your price
range ( ~$6000), however I can aﬃrm it has been a
phenomenol piece of eqiupment for our lab. It’s the
Nanodop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. This spec uses
1-2 ul of solution (which can be retreived without
contamination after a reading has been taken) and
provides a spectrogram from 200-600nm in 15 sec-
onds. Refer to the website for more details http://-
www.nanodrop.com/ . I can also attest that the cus-October 1, 2004 EvolDir 43
tomer service at Nanodrop has been superb. I always
enjoy the opportunity to share my great experiences
with this wonderful piece of equipment. I hope his
helps. ——————
In my work, I need very fast/eﬃcient quantiﬁcation of
low (pre-PCR) concentrations of RNA and DNA. I re-
cently discovered a product by a company called Nan-
odrop, then ND-1000 spectrophotometer. It is more
expensive than the range you are asking for ($7500 US)
but it will save you money over time because it does not
require cuvettes, which can break and are expensive to
replace. The ND-1000 is supposed to be more precise
and read to lower concentrations (down to 1 ng/ul) +/-
0.5 ng/ul I think. It only requires 1 or 2 microliters (ul)
of sample, which are placed directly on an optical lens
with a pipettor, and wiped oﬀ with a kemwipe or other
small tissue paper. This is faster, and uses little of your
sample. I have not used it yet, but have heard great
things, and am just ordering one now. ————-
I haven’t found a good way to do that... I struggled
for months with a Fluorometer (biorad?) and hated it.
Though proported to be amazingly sensitive, I found
that the readings were amazingly inconsistent. UV
spec reading worked better, but not by much. My fa-
vorite way is simply to run it on an agarose gel with a
size marker. If you use some of that fancy dye, green-
something, I think you can visualize pretty small quan-
tities, but I’ve never tried it. If you have a computer
program hooked up to your camera, you can digitally
compute the concentration of DNA. Let me know if you
ﬁnd out something else! —————
Our core lab recently got a nanodrop http://-
www.nanodrop.com/ It is a spectrophotometer, but
you only need to load 1ul of sample, and since it doesnt
get diluted, it is much more sensitive than the typical
spec, where you need to have a large volume of liquid
to ﬁll up a cuvette.
Folks in the lab seem to be pretty happy with it.
For degraded dna - i dont think the nanodrop will dis-
tinguish btw degraded dna and good dna. You probably
need to run your sample on a gel to see how degraded
it is. Then you can do eyeball quantiﬁcation by com-
paring to a mass ladder. —————
We have found Pico Green to be state of the art (has
high aﬃnity for dsDNA and uses very little product).
I do not know the exact amt for the ﬂuorometer, but
cost to maintain is relatively easy and it is much

Eﬀective pop size
Has any research been done correlating Ne (long-term
evolutionary eﬀective pop size) to typical pop sizes for
a variety of organisms?
Lynch & Conery (The Origins of Genome Complex-
ity, Science 302:1401-1402) seem to assume that large
Ne correlates with a large actual pop size and I can
imagine the two as completely uncoupled, since you
could have selective sweeps of beneﬁcial alleles in a very
large population. The paper does brieﬂy mention this
fact, but then still goes on to correlate and make state-
ments about the genome sizes of organisms (prokary-
otes through multicellular eukaryotes) relating to the
population size as aﬀected by selection and drift.
Do Selection and drift act diﬀerentially on populations
with diﬀerent Ne or just diﬀerent pop sizes? My un-
derstanding is selection & drift act diﬀerently on AC-
TUAL pop sizes, but correct me if I’m wrong. I could
not quickly locate any reference that actually correlated
Ne with pop size across a wide range of organisms. Let44 EvolDir October 1, 2004

this.

Eﬀective pop size answers
Thanks to all who replied to my question about the
relationship between N and Ne. Here is a summary
of replies because several people were interested. Best,
Wendee Holtcamp ————————— As you’ll recall
from Jody Hey’s talk, his chimpanzee’s had a very large
eﬀective population size and they actually have a very
low census size. This not uncommon in a conservation
biology context where you have historically large popu-
lations having recently gone through a bottleneck. I’ve
just reviewed a paper on red pandas that had the same
eﬀect. I’ve attached a paper of mine that goes through
some of the diﬀerent estimators and what they are ac-
tually estimating [Crandall, K.A., D. Posada, and D.
Vasco. 1999. Eﬀective population sizes: issing mea-
sures and missing concepts. Animal Conservation. 2:
317-319). It turns out that there are even diﬀerent ef-
fective population sizes and that they can estimate very
diﬀerent things. Hope this helps.
Dr. Keith A. Crandall Brigham Young University ——

One diﬃculty with Ne and N is that the former is mea-
sured in a number of diﬀerent ways. In my talk I was
talking about a long term measure based on the rate
of genetic drift over the depth of genealogies. You’ll
get something very diﬀerent if you just go out and esti-
mate the actual rate of drift from one generation to the
next. We often end up talking about the eﬀective size
experienced by individual loci - loci with fast drift have
small Ne, those with slow drift have high Ne. In this
light, loci with HGT may have a much larger Ne than
loci that do not. Again this is quite an abstraction and
pretty far removed from an N based on census numbers.
Jody Hey, Rutgers University —————————-
Dear Wendee,One such analysis is summarized in Fig. 2.9 and accom-
panying sections of the text (especially pp. 49-60) in
my Phylogeography book (2000; Harvard Univ. Press).
Perhaps you might ﬁnd that of some help or interest.
I’m sure the approach could be greatly extended.

Hi Wendee,
I’m doing my dissertation on environmental inﬂuences
on eﬀective population size and haven’t come across
the kind of reference you are looking for [correlating Ne
with typical pop sizes for a variety of organisms] yet.
seems to me that I ran across a conservation paper that
may have touched on this a bit, and I thought Russ
Lande may have been involved in writing it but on a
casual look I’m not ﬁnding it. I’ll keep looking.
While large Ne needs to have a large N (census size), it
is also possible to have large N with small Ne. While
your observation of selective sweeps is correct, the type
of selection going on would have to be hard selec-
tion and reduce N substatially in order to aﬀect Ne.
And eventually in evolutionary time, Ne would increase
again so your window of time for seeing a small Ne in
a large population that had gone through a selective
sweep would actually be pretty short, in evolutionaryOctober 1, 2004 EvolDir 45
terms.
Drift is more eﬃcient and selection less so in popula-
tions that have small Ne to begin with. Selection is
more eﬀecient in populations with large Ne. It gets
confusing in the evolutionary literature because they
don’t really make distinctions between Ne and N and
mostly they’re talking about Ne, I think.
I’m more of an ecologist and have only recently delved
into the population genetic models we’re talking about
here, but if I can help you any further, please don’t
hesitate to contact me.

Hi,
If your sampling design is relevant, you may test a

Genetic relatedness
Dear colleagues,
We are using the software RELATEDNESS (Queller &Goodnight, 1989) to calculate genetic relatedness be-
tween individuals of known pedigree, using microsatel-
lite loci, for two species of endangered birds. The pop-
ulation sizes are small and genetic diversity is low: only
a few loci (ﬁve and six, respectively) were polymorphic
in each species. One species has only biallelic loci also.
Firstly, we would like to know how to evaluate the sta-
tistical power of the relatedness values that we generate,
given that genetic diversity is so low. For example, in
the species with only 5 biallelic loci, there are only 243
possible genotypes. This is likely to inﬂuence the va-
lidity of comparing 60 individuals all with each other
(~1,800 comparisons), but how can the degree of this
inﬂuence be evaluated?
Also, RELATEDNESS is generating values lower than
-1 (as low as -8), and we are unsure how this is possible.
Is this also a factor of low genetic diversity?
Furthermore, upon evaluating the overall pair-wise ge-
netic relatedness of pairs with pedigree relatedness of
0.5 (parent-oﬀspring, sib-sib) we found an average value
of 0.3, with a very high variance (0.17). We are unsure
how to interpret such a lower value than expected, when
this is an inbred population and we may predict a result
that is even higher than the “expected” value of 0.5.
We have tried using the same data in the program KIN-
SHIP, and generated very similar values, although they
are slightly lower (by around 0.02).
We would appreciate the advice of anyone who has per-
formed a similar analysis.
Thank you,

Hybrid clonalityDear all
I have been analysing a microsatellite data set on two
species of tree and their hybrid. All three taxa show
certain levels of apparent clonality i.e. several individ-
uals with identical multilocus geneotypes.
While I have used MLGsim to test if these MLGs are
due to clonal spread or the product of sexual repro-
duction. Unfortunately, I dont think I can use this ap-
proach for the hybrid individuals.
Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can deter-
mine if indentical MLGs in hybrids are due to clonal
spread or possible multiple hybridization events.
Many thanks

reference to a /method/software to infer/test correla-
tion between intraespieces trees / genealogies.
I have already forwarded the answers to those of you
who emailed me showing an interest in this question,
but further emails asked me to post them in the list, so

1.- One idea would be to correlate the distances but I
guess that could fail to detect important diﬀerences.
2.- I can recommend Page 2003, Tangled trees. The
University of Chicago Press. Inparticular, there is
a chapter by Hulsenbeck, in which he describes a
Bayesian approach. See also, TreeMap (by Page).
3.- You could use CAIC. It is either www.caic.org.au, or
elsewww.bio.ic.ac.uk/evolve/software/caic/ 4.- There
are of course very diﬀerent elements to ’correlations’
of thetypes you talk about, notably the topologies of
phylogenies as opposedto the depths.The works of Rod
Page and Mike Charleston are worth a close look, and-
some other people have hands-on solutions around these
issues. Here are some starting points:
Page RDM, and Charleston MA. 1998. Trees within
trees: phylogeny andhistorical associations. Trends
in Ecology & Evolution 13: 356-359. Schneider
CJ, Smith TB, Larison B, and Moritz C. 1999. A
test ofalternative models of diversiﬁcation in tropi-
cal rainforests:Ecological gradients vs. rainforest refu-
gia. PNAS 96: 13869-13873. Sullivan J, Arellano E,
and Rogers DS. 2000. Comparative phylogeographyof
mesoamerican highland rodents: Concerted versus in-
dependent responseto past climatic ﬂuctuations. Amer-
ican Naturalist 155: 755-768.
5.- I don’t have an answer for you query as such but I
know that there are many methods to compare diﬀer-
ent trees in the ﬁeld of ’supertrees’, i.e. the combining
of many small trees into one large consensus tree con-
taining all the taxa. It is hard to say without knowing
exactly what you need to do but one of the methods
used by the supertree people may be applicable in your
case. There is a guy in Ireland (James McInerney) who
works on supertrees and, if you like, I could forward on
some details to him and see if he can suggest a solution.
6.- I don’t know if I exactly understood your
problem. However, there are quite some methods
that compute distances between trees (i.e. some-
thing similar tocorrelation).My ﬁrst try would be
component from Rod Page which implements severald-istancemetrics and is available for windows: http:/-
/taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/cpw.html and
macintosh: http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/-
cplite/guide.html . Also, there is the excellent website
of Joe Felsenstein, which provideslinks to manypro-
grams related to phylogenies and tree comparison:
http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/-
software.html#Consensus 7.- Have you tried looking
at something like Brooks parsimony? there’s achapter
in the recent Joe Felsenstein book about testing for
concordancebetween trees i think... You might want to
take a look at that.
8.- I guess this can be broken down into two questions:
1. Do the trees for the genes have the same phylogeny,
i.e. are they evolving together within lineages? 2. If
they are evolving together, are there any site that show
coevolution between the two?
I’m afraid my experience is largely with interspecies
trees, where the answer to question 1 is a much clearer
’yes’ because they are evolving along the same species
lineages. With your intra-speciﬁc trees is there likely
to be lots of recombination etc. between the two pro-
teins, or are your diﬀerent humans(/populations?) suf-
ﬁciently separate that the two proteins should be evolv-
ing together? (I mean this in the sense that they are
being inherited together rather than that they are di-
rectly inﬂuencing each other’s evolution.) If they are,
then I guess you could draw a tree from the concate-
nated sequences and then use a method such as the
one below to scan for coevolving sites across the diﬀer-
ent sequences. I am not sure, however, whether there
would be enough information within a species to per-
form these kinds of tests. You may be better of looking
for coevolution using interspeciﬁc trees and then map-
ping those sites onto your intraspeciﬁc data to see if it
still ﬁts?
If it is question 1 that you are asking then I think there
are maximum likelihood tree-drawing programs (possi-
bly MrBayes) that can assign a posterior probability to
an input tree given the data, which you may be able to
use to see how much worse the receptor tree is if you
make it look like the ligand tree, for example. Again,
though, I think these will be designed

Molecular Data Analysis
I would like to calculate automatically the number of
diﬀerent haplotypes detected in the set of lines I have
examined. I would be grateful if you could let me know
if there is a program that can count the number of dif-
ferent haplotypes.

DAMBE ( http://aix1.uottawa.ca/ ˜ xxia/ ) has a “fea-
ture” of scornfully telling you:
“Some sequences are identical. Identical sequences
should be represented by just a single sequence and a
single sequence name. Do you wish to keep only unique
sequences in DAMBE’s buﬀer?”
If you hit “Yes”, ...
You could then count what you had left!

The TOPALi (pronounced Toe-Pal-Eye) program can
input an alignment and select a unique subset by keep-
ing one member of each group of identical sequences.
However, even better, try this....
Use TOPALi to construct a phylogenetic tree: you can
then ask TOPALi to shade clusters according to simi-
larity, so TOPALi will do exactly what you want.
You can download TOPALi (GUI, runs on PCs, MAC
X, Linux, etc) from:
http://www.bioss.ac.uk/˜iainm/scri.html Instructions
for using TOPALi to shade clusters of identical se-
quences New Project Choose location for project ﬁle
(which holds data and results) Load alignment
Analysis >Settings (choose F84+Gamma/Neighbor
Joining) Analysis >Create phylogenetic tree (with or
without bootstrapping - you choose)
Go to tree graphic window - choose second last icon

ilarity (0.0 for identical sequences) TOPALi will now
shade clusters (in diﬀerent colours)

MolecularClock answers
Dear EvolDir members,
following my recent queries on molecular clock issues I
received four answers and several people requested that
I post the answers. I think some very interesting issues
were raised and I would like to thank all the people who
took their time to answer. With my best wishes, Lukas
1) Paul O. Lewis Doing two separate searches (one with
clock constraints enforced and the other without con-
straints on branch lengths) would be the best approach
if the likelihood ratio test did not require models to
be nested. Using the same tree topology, the “clock”
model is a constrained version of the “non-clock” model
and the LR statistics will be approximately chi-squared.
If the topology changes between clock and non-clock hy-
potheses, all bets are oﬀ with respect to the goodness of50 EvolDir October 1, 2004
the chi-squared approximation because the two models
being compared are no longer nested. (Diﬀerent tree
topologies represent diﬀerent non-nested models.)
If one is going to conduct a test then and look up
the LR statistic in a chi-squared table to assess signiﬁ-
cance, you need to keep the topology the same. Usually
the null hypothesis is the simpler one (i.e. more con-
strained) so it seems that the search should be done
under the constrained (i.e. clock) model and then the
constraints relaxed (but keeping the topology the same)
to obtain the unconstrained likelihood for comparison.
I would be interested to hear arguments from others,
however, on a possible rationale for performing the
toplogy search under the non-clock model.
2) Ziheng Yang In theory, you should use the correct
tree (the tree that represents the biological relation-
ships among the sequences) to calculate the lnL under
the clock and non-clock models. If the correct tree is
unknown, I suspect (a) is a better choice than (b) if
you are going to use the chi square. You might use
two or three trees to check that the test results are not
sensitive to the tree topology assumed. If you use (b),
you should not use the chi square since the two models
are not nested. I am not sure about the r8s program,
but the LRT can be done using a number of programs
such as phylip, paup, and paml. You should watch out
for the likelihood calculations under the clock as some
programs might have problems.
If you have diﬃculty in deciding whether the clock
should be rejected, there is probably no point in do-
ing rate smoothing. You could just assume the clock
for date estimation. Often the clock is so wrong that
there is no need for a formal test. If the tree is really
clock, a sensible method should be able to deal with it,
so I can’t see anything wrong in applying the algorithm
on a clock-like tree. Also the rate smoothing algorithms
require estimates of branch lengths without the clock,
so the likelihood calculation under the clock should not
be a limitation.
3) Kenneth Kozak With regards to question 2, the rea-
son to use NPRS or PL is to obtain ultrametric branch
lengths when the data reject a molecular clock. The
methods for generating molecular clock trees you men-
tioned result in ultrametric trees. So, there is no need
to transform the branch lengths using NPRS or PL be-
cause the branch lengths will already be proportional
to time.
On another note, you can use Mr. Bayes to do and
MCMC search under the restriction of a molecular
clock. My experience with this approach is that it goes
much faster than doing a ML search with a molecular
clock enforced.Mr. Bayes version 3.04 will do searches with a molec-
ular clock enforced. One thing that might be worth
exploring is doing an unconstrained search and then a
search with the molecular clock enforced. If the data
are consistent with a molecular clock, then the 95% pos-
terior probability distributions for the likelhood scores
of these two analyses should overlap.
4) Toby Johnson Your observation that (b) gives bet-
ter likelihood scores than (a) is general, because (a) is a
special case of (b). That is, the space you are maximis-
ing the likelihood over with option (a) is a sub-space
of the space you are maximising over with option (b),
and therefore option (b) is guaranteed to have greater
or equal likelihood.
Option (b) seems to me the right approach to take.
BUT If you use diﬀerent topologies (option (b)) you
cannot use a LRT. This test can only be used when
you have a nested sub-model in continuous parame-
ter space (because it relies on asymptotic normality of
the ln-likelihood function). That is, the simpler model
(clock) must be obtained from the more geneal model
(no clock) by setting continuously varying parameters
to predetermined values. Branch lengths are continu-
ous, tree topologies are not.
Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) or the Schwarz
Criterion (BIC) can in principle be used to choose be-
tween non-nested models. You might also be able to
estimate the Bayes Factor between the two models us-
ing a program like MrBayes.

PCR evaporation
Dear All, My question maybe is trivial but I would
like to know if you also encounter this problem and if
there is any good solution (a perfect supplier?). Some-
times during long cycles one or more reactions evapo-
rates - I have two MJResearch PTC-200 cyclers (block
96x0,2ml) and usually work with 10ul mixes. I have
tried diﬀerent suppliers (e.g. Merck, Biozym, Axygen,
MJResearch) - some tubes/plates are completely use-
less and most that do not let the liquid evaporate are
very hard to open - I am always aﬀraid I will mix prod-
ucts while opening them. Using oil or wax would surely
help but... come on, it is XXI century now! :) Is there a
perfect sealing system? I also wish to know your opin-
ions on diﬀerent suppliers and their products - maybe
someone already did a kind of rakning of plasticware?

PCR evaporation answers
Dear All, Many thanks for the answers to one of the
most trivial questions about PCR anyone could ever
ask: How to keep the liquid inside the tube? I have
noticed that during PCR, reaction mixtures evaporate
from some tubes. I have asked you if there is some per-
fect solution for sealing tubes, or perfect plastic-ware.
The conclusions are:
1. Oil is valuable as always but troublesome too (don’t
annoy weapon inspectors :)
2. Silicon seals are almost perfect, however, I have seri-
ous doubts about using them when dealing with mu-
seum material - it is hard to be too careful. They
are simply too expensive for single use and the only
reusable thing I allow to contact with PCR tubes (al-
ready sealed!) is thermocycler.3. Sealing tapes are good if applied properly. One can
also tighten the seal with silicon mate between the tape
and heating cover. During longer storage some likeage
may take place.
4. Larger reaction volumes are good (25-50ul instead
of 5-10ul) but when the number of reactions is large, it
is also too expensive.
5. It seems that this problem is more likely to occur
in MJResearch machines (which I love truely) than in
Perkin-Elmer/ABi or Eppendroﬀ.
Some of you have asked me to post the answers. There
you are!
—- Did you tried rubber seals for your plates or just
the sticker ones?? rubber seals work ﬁne in Applied
biosystems machines and I heard that the same is valid
for MJ PCRs
—- Here, we use oil! Could you send us, after a while,
a summmary of the answers?
—- Our lab uses MJ thermocyclers too. I’ve tried a lot
of combinations of plates and sealing ﬁlms, and some
work and some don’t. One hint is to always lay a ﬂat
silicone mat (we use Axygen brand) on top of sealing
ﬁlm. It helps make a better seal than the metal of the
heated bonnet.
—- I have encountered this problem before and it is in-
deed frustrating. In general, I have liked the eppendorf
single tubes, although it has been a while since I have
run a reaction that goes more than 10 hrs or so.
—- I would be very interested in hearing your responses
for both of the questions you posted on EvolDir. Be-
cause we have pressure ﬁt lids on our thermocyclers
(we use MJ Research PTC-100 and Eppendorf ther-
mocyclers), we currently use rubber mats (distributed
by ISC BioExpress, cat #T-3161-1) to seal our 96-
well plates for PCR (our plates are skirtless ones from
Denville), and rarely have problems with evaporation.
However, these mats do not work without pressure ﬁt
lids, and do not seal reactions well following PCR. Af-
ter our PCRs are completed, we use sealing tape (also
distributed by ISC BioExpress, cat #T-3021-7). We
are not extremely pleased with the ability of the tape to
seal the reactions for long periods of time post-PCR. As
for tubes, we use ﬂat-topped PCR tubes from Denville,
and they have worked pretty well for us. If you are wor-
ried about opening tubes, you could try microcentrifuge
tube openers (check any major supplier).
—- I’m not familiar with the machine you are using.
The ﬁrst question is whether it has a hot top. If not,
there is nothing you can do to prevent evaporation, and
you’re stuck with wax or oil, even in the XXI century52 EvolDir October 1, 2004
;-) If you already have a hot top, I’d suggest that you
use a larger volume. Ten microL is darn little in a 0.2
ml tube (I’m guessing), go up to 50 microL of reaction
and see whether this takes care of your troubles.
—- We have two PCR machines, an Eppendorf Master
Cycler (Gradient) and an Applied Biosystems PE 9700.
We currently use strip tubes distributed by Sarsted (not
sure if they also manufacture them or not) and are mov-
ing to Axygen plates. The strip tubes never evaporate
unless they are not sealed tightly by the researcher. I
had a few diﬃculties with the plates in the beginning
but have now found that using the clear sealing ﬁlm
works perfectly (as long as the user seals the plates
completely with the ﬁlm). We use a small wallpaper
roller to get a good seal.
Hope this helps, but if there is a wider scale, more stan-
dardized comparison available I’d like to know about it.
—- evaporation sometimes occurs. But in general, it
should not be a problem. I use cheap 96 well plates
(ﬁsher brand, cheapest) with a silicone plate sealer.
Most plate sealers are junk and allow evaporation. But
there is one style, made or at least distributed by a cou-
ple of vendors, that works. It has a button shaped semi-
circular nub that projects into the well, and a small thin
point on top that gets pushed down when you tighten
the lid. Teh combination of pushing this sealer onto
the plate adequately, and tightening the lid down suf-
ﬁciently has resulted in almost no cases of evaporation
for me. I’ve even done 5 ul reactions with no loss. Make
sealer vendors send you samples until youﬁnd one that
works. Test them with 5 ul of water in every well and
run it all the way through your cycle.

Peer reviewed creationist
Dear all, With the unfortunate publication of a cre-
ationist article in a peer reviewed journal (see this weeks
Sept. 9th Nature, page 114), I was wondering if there
is anything we can or should do about it. It appears
that the journal in question (The Proceedings of the
Biological Society of Washington) has been hijacked bya creationist editor who has now provided them with
unfounded legitimacy by being able to cite a peer re-
viewed journal.
Some responses we might think about:
1) Get our libraries to cancel any orders for this journal.
2) Boycott peer reviewing and citation of any papers of
the journal.
3) Put a list of the members of the The Biological So-
ciety of Washington on the Evolution Directory so that
we can let them know that it is irresponsible for them
to chose such an editor. This should be a warning to all
of us who belong to various societies to pay attention
and to take the responsibility of running journals very
seriously.
I think that most would agree that this society and the
journal has made all of lives more diﬃcult with this
slip up. Maybe doing nothing is better and simply dis-
missing it as a ﬂuke would be the best strategy at this
point. Some of the suggestions above might be too ex-
treme and only heighten the impact in their favor, but
I would at least hope that those of you in this society
will reconsider your choice of editors, and that if you
know someone in the society you will have a conversa-
tion with them about taking their professional respon-
sibilities more seriously.

Dear Joel,
I understand your concern about this, but I think the
best thing to do would indeed be to ignore the incident.
We all know peer review isn’t perfect, and that science
is – after all – a human activity. But we don’t need to
give more ammunitions to creationists by mounting a
boycott campaign.
On the other hand, of course, the journal in question
has lost credibility (so does Cambridge Press, for anal-
ogous reasons, which is much more worrysome), so eachOctober 1, 2004 EvolDir 53
of us is perfectly entitled not to submit papers to them.
Your warnings about taking choices of editors and pub-
lishers more seriously, of course, are also right on the
mark.

Hi Joel (and others),
As an administrator of the internet site ( http://-
www.pandasthumb.org/ ) that ﬁrst broke the news ofthis paper, I can tell you that we are working on it. The
people who actively watch and ﬁght against the anti-
evolution movement have well addressed the “paper.”
The issue now is countering and publicizing the spin
that anti-evolutionists are doing. NCSE is working with
the journal to get them to draft a more strongly worded
denial of the paper. You can follow developments and
debate about the paper at The Panda’s Thumb ( http:/-
/www.pandasthumb.org/ ).
Addressing a couple points you mentioned:
The editor in question published Meyer’s paper as the
last thing he did before he resigned. He is no longer
in charge, and the journal is institution a more struc-
tured editorial policy. There is no evidence that the
BSW knew that their former editor was a creationist.
There is evidence that he intentionally hid this from
them. They are in a tough position and simply not ex-
perienced enough to handle the anti-evolution political
game. It is very clear from the vast scientiﬁc errors in
the paper and from the fact that its topic was outside
the scope of the journal that it did not receive critical
peer review. It has also come to light that about 40% of
the paper had been previously published by the author
and colleagues.
I will also point out that there is another peer-reviewed
paper by anti-evolutionists that we are working on ad-
dressing. The reference is “Behe MJ & Snoke DW
(2004) Protein Science. Aug 31 [Epub ahead of print].”
This one is not as egregious as the ﬁrst, and is just an
unremarkable, rather ﬂawed, theory paper. We can see
how it got published, since questionable papers do get
published from time to time.

MENT FROM THE COUNCIL OF THE BIOLOGI-
CAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON
The paper by Stephen C. Meyer in the Proceedings
(“The origin of biological information and the higher
taxonomic categories,” vol. 117, no. 2, pp. 213-
239) represents a signiﬁcant departure from the nearly
purely taxonomic content for which this journal has
been known throughout its 124-year history. It was
published without the prior knowledge of the Coun-
cil, which includes oﬃcers, elected councilors, and past
presidents, or the associate editors. We have met and
determined that all of us would have deemed this paper
inappropriate for the pages of the Proceedings.
We endorse the spirit of a resolution on Intelligent
Design set forth by the American Association for
the Advancement of Science ( www.aaas.org/news/-
releases/2002/1106id2.shtml ), and that topic will not
be addressed in future issues of the Proceedings.
We are reviewing editorial policies to ensure that
the goals of the Society, as reﬂected in its jour-
nal, are clearly understood by all. Through a web
presence ( www.biolsocwash.org ) and contemplated im-
provements in the journal, the Society hopes not only
to continue but to increase its service to the world com-
munity of taxonomic biologists.

Dear Colleagues, I am glade that the Proc. Biol. Sci.
Wash. have explained how the publication of the paper
by Meyer was mistake– which I take as equivalent to
retracting the paper. However, I am worried about the
strength of the reaction of part of the Scientiﬁc Com-
munity to the publication of the paper in question.
We have diﬀerent options for dealing with Creationists:
We can boycott them and prevent them from publish-
ing, we can also ignore them, or we can open bridges of
discussion with them and even give them space in our
tribunes.
In my opinion, boycotting is the wrong thing to do;
mainly because they will easily interpret it, and instru-
mentalize it as proof of their persecution– they will be
the ’poor victims’ of the ’evil Evolutionists’. I also think
that the boycott of ideas is a dangerous and scary thing,
and it does not agree with the open and critical mind
of an Evolutionist.
Ignoring Creationist opinions does not resolve the prob-
lem neither. Ignored Creationists will use it as a proof
of their strength and claim that Evolutionists are un-
able to ’face’ them and answer their criticism.
However, I think that being more ’tolerant’ with them
will invalidate their excuses and instrumentalizations.
It will also attract those of them who still can have a
mind critical enough to admit that hiding is the only
power of their supposed intelligent designer. We have
also to recognize that, in addition to the criticism made
by Evolutionists to contributions of their fellow Evolu-
tionists, some of the criticism made by creationists have
stimulated more work on Evolution, and contributed to
improve the Theory, or at least speed-up its improve-
ment.

I recently received this from our good scientiﬁc bud-
dies the Raelians, the same group that claims a close
acquaintance with space aliens, and made a big splash
with unsubstantiated claims of human cloning two years
ago. They believe that life on earth was engineered by
aliens.
On the one hand, I suspect this is a preview of what we
will hear from many creationist groups.
On the other hand, the fact that the Raelians want to
pile on should help illustrate the range of craziness that
we deal with. This fact can be a very useful pro-science,
anti-creationist tool, as pointed out by Massimo Pigli-
ucci in his recent book Denying Evolution.

Peer reviewed creationist 8
Dear colleagues,
I agree with Mohammed Bakkali that censorship based
on a disagrement about how we think the world works
is unwise at best and unscientiﬁc at worst. Since the
proponents of ID claim to be willing to play by the
rules of scientiﬁc research, I would encourage them do
so: show us good, solid sience and we will be happy
to listen. The issue then boils down to a very simple
matter: the quality of the science.
It seems that the paper that started all this got pub-
lished without peer review. In my opinion it shouldn’t
be retracted because it comes from an ID proponent,
it should be sent out for review and judged on the ba-
sis of its sientiﬁc merit. If the science is bad, then it
shouldn’t be published.
Bad science should be kept out of journals, not matter
who is responsible for it. We have all seen papers in
top tier journals that have made us pull our hair, and
no one has ever suggested to boycott the journal or to
have the editors retract it. Making ID proponents stick56 EvolDir October 1, 2004
to the rules of the scientiﬁc process is all we really need.
And if they ever manage to do it, so be it.
Cheers! isabel novella Medical College of Ohio

Peer reviewed creationist 9
A number of years ago (5?) I attended an AAAS
SWARM meeting in Flagstaﬀ. I was surprised to see
that individuals who still believe in the ether theory
to explain physical experimental results that are better
explained by Relativity were given presentation time.
I believe the organizer who allowed this either may
not have known (or apprectiated) how discredited ether
theories are, or has a belief in the free expression of
ideas. I believe having given etherists a forum in such
an important scientiﬁc organization as the AAAS was
very inapropriate, but I never heard of any repercus-
sions, perhaps because it is not such an emotionally
charged, social, and political issue as creationism.

I am looking for a computer program that calculates
and /or plots uncorrected pairwise distances using tran-
sitions and transversions versus corrected distances.
The program must be able to handle large data sets (eg
100 000 comparisons) and various substitution models.
I would be grateful if you could let me know if there is
such a program.

Selection contents
The journal Selection has published papers of outstand-
ing researchers mainly in population genetics, game
theory, adaptive dynamics, and language evolution.
Sadly, the journal did not enjoy good circulation and
ceased after its third volume.
Yet many of these papers are much too valuable to
slip into obscurity. I circulate the contents of the
journal to let you ﬁnd if you need some of them
(in author email addresses, [*] replaces the funny
character to defend against spammers). Special is-
sues on adaptive dynamics and on language evolu-
tion are in the second and third volumes, respec-
tively. Free abstracts and pay pdfs are available on the
publisher’s website ( http://www.akkrt.hu/kerdesek/-

Software SeqGen v1 3
I have just uploaded a new version of Seq-Gen to our
web site:
http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/software/seqgen/ Seq-Gen
is a program that will simulate the evolution of nu-
cleotide or amino acid sequences along a phylogeny,
using common models of the substitution process. A
range of models of molecular evolution are implemented
including the general reversible model. State frequen-
cies and other parameters of the model may be given
and site-speciﬁc rate heterogeneity may also be incor-
porated in a number of ways. Any number of trees may
be read in and the program will produce any number of
data sets for each tree. Thus large sets of replicate sim-
ulations can be easily created. It has been designed to
be a general purpose simulator that incorporates most
of the commonly used (and computationally tractable)October 1, 2004 EvolDir 59
models of DNA sequence evolution.
The new version allows the simulation of amino acid
sequence (previously in our separate program, PSeq-
Gen) but also includes some additional models of AA
substitution.
Thanks, Andrew

Software Transformer-2
Dear colleagues,
We are announcing the release of TRANSFORMER-
2, a computer program for the analysis of molecular
population genetic data which is suitable for codomi-
nant (allozyme or microsatellite) data for at least 60
enzyme/primers with up to 10 loci (each containing a
maximum of 10 alleles) per enzyme/primer in 66,000
diploid individuals.
Through saving a lot of research time while increas-
ing accuracy, Transformer-2 permits the eﬀective im-
plementation of urgency in the growing number of prac-
tical applications of molecular population genetic infor-
mation.
This program is the result of a collaborative eﬀort be-
tween the Jardin Botanico Canario Viera y Clavijo and
the Departamento de Ingenieria del Software of the In-
stituto Tecnologico de Canarias (ITC). It can be down-
loaded without charge at the web page of the Jardin
Botanico Canario Viera y Clavijo
http://www.jardincanario.org (under the link Gen´ etica
de la Conservaci´ on),
and may be distributed freely if and when (i) it does not
undergo any modiﬁcation, (ii) the manual and the two
example ﬁles transf-draw.xls and transf-gntp.xls are at-
tached without changes, and (iii) it is adequately cited
in all papers and communications.
Caujape-Castells J, Baccarani-Rosas M (2004)
Transformer-2: a program for the analysis of molecular
population genetic data. Jardin Botanico Canario
Viera y Clavijo and Instituto Tecnologico de Canarias,Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.
DESCRIPTION
At present, you can feed Transformer-2 with the draw-
ings of the interpretations of your molecular patterns
(a utility that will probably be most welcome by those
using allozymes) or with a matrix of genotypes.
For those using the drawing utility, Transformer-2 oﬀers
a versatile and intuitive data entry interface that makes
corrections and manipulations fairly easy to implement.
The major advantage of drawing the interpretations is
that, once you are done, quantitative data for any pos-
sible conﬁguration of populations and loci will be a few
seconds away. However, there are at least three addi-
tional reasons to use this tool of Transformer-2:
1. You can forget about genotyping individuals, as the
program will do it for you from the drawing. There-
fore, you are less prone to make the mistakes that are
so frequent when you interpret by hand.
2. You may correct or modify your interpretations by
moving, inserting or deleting any number of individ-
uals, alleles, loci or spaces easily at any point of the
interpretation process.
3. You will have a permanent visual record of the in-
terpretations which is much easier to scan and check
than a whole table of genotypes and which can be used
nicely in presentations (see the attached ﬁle /lessmuchtransf-
draw.xls/greatermuch).
Either if you draw your interpretations or if you en-
ter a Table of genotypes, Transformer-2 automatically
generates the necessary ﬁles to run six genetic analy-
sis programs of widespread use in population genetics
(Biosys, GeneStat, Bottleneck, PopGene, GenePop and
Ntsys), and calculates all the parameters related to the
probabilities of allelic loss (sensu Bengtsson et al. 1995)
FOR ANY GROUPINGS OF POPULATIONS YOU
MAY BE INTERESTED IN. Thus, the program allows
you to deﬁne population subsets, compare independent
groups of populations, include the same population (s)
in more than one group and make all possible data com-
binations you can think of just with a few easy mouse
clicks.
Transformer-2 is already being improved to include a
much wider range of possibilities and calculations. A
new version that will accept RAPD and AFLP data is
already in the pipeline, and we hope to have it ready
before spring 2005. In a longer term, we plan to have a
Transformer that performs most of the calculations in-
volved in the analysis of molecular population genetic
data while keeping the versatility of the present version.

Video animal tracking
Hi there
I wish to quantify movement of beetles from digital
video. They are black in colour and can be ﬁlmed indi-
vidually against a pale background, and I want to know
how far they move and at what speed over a given time
period. Does anyone know of any freely available soft-
ware to calculate this? It’s a fairly simple problem: just
ﬁnd the x and y coordinates of a black spot once per
frame, and output it to a text ﬁle along with a time
stamp. There’s obviously lots of commercial packages,
but I don”t really want to shell out the thousands nec-
essary for an ethovision license. Any advice gratefully
received.

experienced similar problems. Whenever I try to use
any of the commands begin data; begin character; be-

program can still complete a parsimony or likelihood
analyses with no apparent problems. I have tried using
diﬀerent ﬁle formats but this has made no diﬀerence.
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

CornellU CanineGenomics
Post-doctoral positions in canine genomics.
Two post-doctoral positions are available to study the
genetic & biologic basis of abnormal cardiac innerva-
tion, ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death
in German shepherd dogs. Study of these animals will
provide important insights into inherited cardiac dis-
eases in animals and humans. These studies are part of
a collaborative eﬀort between Drs. Sydney Moise and
Teresa Gunn in the Departments of Clinical Sciences
and Biomedical Sciences in the College of Veterinary
Medicine at Cornell University (Ithaca, NY) and Dr.
Karen Vikstrom in the Department of Pharmacology
at SUNY-Upstate Medical University (Syracuse, NY).
Our German shepherd dogs have an inherited predis-
position to abnormal cardiac innervation, ventricular
arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Although the
mode of inheritance has not been well deﬁned, it is con-
sistent with a major susceptibility locus that is inﬂu-
enced by modiﬁer loci. The aim of our research is todetermine the genes involved and understand the bio-
logical pathway(s) that are disrupted to cause this dis-
ease. Two projects are available: 1) Screening German
shepherd dogs from aﬀected and unaﬀected dogs from
our colony for genetic markers and performing link-
age analysis to map modiﬁer loci, followed by analy-
sis of candidate genes. Funding is provided for 2 years
with possibility of extension. 2) Microarray analysis
of archived heart tissue from aﬀected and unaﬀected
German shepherd dogs using canine Aﬀymetrix arrays,
followed by validation and analysis of gene expression
diﬀerences. Funding is provided for 18 months with
possibility of extension. Some of the work will be per-
formed at SUNY-Upstate.
Position requirements: Ph.D. or equivalent degree with
a focus on genetics, molecular biology or related ﬁeld of
study. Candidates should submit a current CV, a state-
ment of research experience, and the names of three
individuals who could provide letters of reference to

CornellU HumanPopGenetics
Postdoctoral position in computational human popula-
tion genetics at Cornell Carlos Bustamante, Rasmus
Nielsen, Tara Matise and Andy Clark seek an ener-
getic postdoctoral fellow to engage in NIH-funded re-
search on the analysis of dense, genome-wide SNP geno-
type data such as that being produced by the HapMap
project. We are pursuing a series of investigations that
center around the following four aims: 1. SNPs used in
these large projects have been ascertained in separate
re-sequencing projects. We plan to investigate the con-
sequences to a variety of inferences of failing to consider
this ascertainment bias, and methods for correcting this
bias. 2. Positive, purifying, and balancing selection, as
well as demographic changes, all are expected to in-
ﬂuence the site frequency spectrum, patterns of linkage
disequilibrium, and other aspects of SNP variation. We
will be developing methods to infer the impact of nat-
ural selection on genomic regions, testing their validity
and robustness, and applying them to dense genotype
data. 3. Population genetics theory shows that local
rates of recombination are expected to have an impact
on the eﬃcacy of natural selection, which in turn inﬂu-
ences linkage disequilibrium, frequency spectrum, and
other population genetic attributes of SNPs. We are de-
veloping formal statistical approaches to parameter es-
timation and hypothesis testing, centering on the null
hypothesis that variability among genomic regions in
local population genetic attributes is explicable by the
local recombination rate. This entails analysis of the
data, both direct and indirect, supporting inferences
about local recombination rate.
4. The dense LD map provided by HapMap enables us
to simulate disease associations so as to quantify the
power whole-genome LD association inference. These
tests will help identify the attributes of local LD that
best predict the power of association tests, and will
serve as additional guidance to identify regions requir-
ing more dense SNP coverage. Our research groups
provide a lively and stimulating research environment.
Facilities include a 50 dual-G5 processor cluster (run
by our group), and access to the Cornell Theory Center
Velocity Cluster. Please email your resume, statement
of research interests and contact information for threereferences to Andrew Clark (ac347@cornell.edu) and/or

is available immediately, but we can be ﬂexible.

A POSTDOCTORAL POSITION in evolutionary biol-
ogy is available in the laboratory of Todd Streelman at
the Georgia Institute of Technology. The candidate for
this position will be expected to carry out independent
research contributing to the major focus of the labora-
tory: the genetic basis of functional and phenotypic di-
versity in cichlid ﬁshes from Lake Malawi, East Africa.
In the past few years, the cichlid community has built
an array of genomic resources ( http://hcgs.unh.edu/-
cichlid/ ) to complement decades of natural history in-
formation. Using these tools in the context of wild cich-
lid populations, the Streelman lab aims to understand
the evolutionary genesis of complex organismal designs.
We study cichlids in the ﬁeld, in the laboratory, and in
the tropical aquarium facilities at the GIT. Research is
presently focused on the evolution of jaws, teeth and
color pattern because these traits have been important
to cichlid diversiﬁcation (for representative publica-
tions, see http://www.biology.gatech.edu/professors/-
streelman.htm ).
Candidates working in evolutionary ecology, biome-
chanics, quantitative genetics or evolutionary develop-
ment, are especially encouraged to apply. The Georgia
Institute of Technology oﬀers exciting avenues for col-
laboration with biomedical engineers, biomechanicians,
developmental biologists and systems ecologists.
The start date for this position is ﬂexible, and fund-
ing is available for at least two years. The salary is
competitive and commensurate with experience. In-
terested individuals should send a CV, a brief descrip-
tion of research and professional goals, and the names
and addresses of 3 references to Todd Streelman, by
e-mail (todd.streelman@biology.gatech.edu) or regular
mail (School of Biology, 310 Ferst Drive, Georgia Insti-
tute of Technology, Atlanta, GA 30332-0230).

POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCHER in Population ge-
netics/Molecular Ecology
A Post-doctoral researcher is required for a project on
population genetics and molecular ecology in bladder-
wrack (Fucus vesiculosus, a marine macro algae) during
the period October 2004 to August 2006, at the Depart-
ment of Marine Ecology, G¨ oteborg University.
The project is funded by grants to Kerstin Johannesson
& Lena Kautsky
The position is available at Tj¨ arn¨ o Marine Biological
Laboratory, a research station at G¨ oteborg and Stock-
holm universities, on the west coast of Sweden.
The project will use microsatellites to evaluate popula-
tion structure in the marine brown algae Fucus vesiculo-
sus and particularly in populations of the Baltic. Fucus
vesiculosus is a keystone species of shallow marine hard-
bottom communities in the Baltic. Preliminary studies
show a high degree of substructure as well as reproduc-
tive isolation between the normal and a dwarf morph
conﬁned to northern parts of the Baltic. Moreover, the
dwarf morph reproduce asexually using proliﬁcations
growing from the stem. This is an hitherto unknown
strategy and one aim of this project is to investigate
this strategy in more detail to unravel how and where
it has evolved and why. We will also assess the dis-
tribution and taxonomic status of the dwarf morph to
clear out if it is endemic to the Baltic. Clonal reproduc-
tion is present also in the normal morph suggesting that
this is a unique adaptation to extreme environmental
conditions, such as low salinities.
The successful applicant should have a proﬁciency in
microsatellite analyses and DNA sequencing methods.
It is also essential that the applicant has a proper the-
oretical background in population genetics and is expe-
rienced with computer-based tools of analysis. Knowl-
edge in screening of genomic (BAC) libraries, cloning
and subcloning and making cDNA libraries is valuable
for the proper development of this and related projects
and will be judged as a merit.For further information please contact Kerstin Jo-
hannesson (kejo@tmbl.gu.se). For a general infor-
mation about the research station please consult

CV, a choice of three-ﬁve relevant publications, the

Marie Curie Research training network (MRTN) SEX-
ASEX - 4 postdoc positions available
Students and researchers interested in the paradox of
sex in evolutionary biology are strongly encouraged to
send an expression of interest to work in the European
Union Marie Curie Research Training Network SEXA-
SEX that is co- ordinated by Prof. Dr. Koen Martens,
RBINSc, Brussels. Criteria of eligibility include: EU
citizenship, less than 4 years of research experience for
Young Researchers (YR), less than 10 years for Experi-
enced Researchers (ER), and a willingness to work in a
European country other than the country of origin. We
seek candidates who are enthusiastic about evolution-
ary biology, travelling and living abroad, learning in a
multidisciplinary research environment and working in
teams. All appointments will be for 3 years, YR are
oﬀered PhD positions, ER post-doc positions. YR will
be expected to obtain a PhD at the end of the project.
The application of female candidates is especially en-
couraged; detailed information on child care facilities
at the diﬀerent institutions will be provided upon re-
quest. Aid can be sought if accompanying spouses also
require employment abroad.
Project overview: Sex is the queen of evolutionary
problems. It will be tackled by SEXASEX in a mul-
tidisciplinary approach, providing training and trans-
fer of knowledge for a total of 360 person-months. 10
network researchers (6 young researchers (YR) and 4
experienced researchers (ER)) will receive training in
9 institutions across as many countries. A wide ar-
ray of research tools will provide excellent training op-
portunities, for example through individual career de-
velopment plans, individual tutoring and secondments,
which will be supplemented by participation in courses
and external workshops. Network-wide training will ex-
ploit the extensive experience of the partner institutions
through ﬁve courses and summer schools for all network
researchers. Complementary skills such as management
and communication (verbal, written) will be developed,
and gender awareness will be raised, in two network-
wide meetings. The network’s theoretical and empiri-cal research will apply 13 major approaches, including
novel genomic and karyological approaches, intraspe-
ciﬁc phylogeography, ecology, behavioural studies, GIS
analyses and theoretical modelling. With this mul-
tidisciplinary toolkit, SEXASEX will investigate why
sex exists at all, given its evolutionary costs, using the
model organism Eucypris virens, a non-marine ostra-
cod species with both sexual and asexual reproduction.
What determines its gender, what are the genomic con-
sequences of long-term asexuality, what is the cohesive-
ness of a species with mixed reproduction, how do asex-
uals and sexuals compete and what is their historical
zoogeography? The pluralistic approach of SEXASEX
is unique and timely, using highly novel methodologies
and dealing with cutting edge science based on Euro-
pean excellence and tradition.

EvolInteractions
Postdoc, Evolution of Tritrophic Interactions
A postgraduate research position is available for a
highly motivated individual to join an NSF-funded re-
search project to study the evolution of a tritrophic in-
teraction. The primary objective is to test the working
hypothesis that the indirect eﬀects of the glandular tri-
chomes of Datura wrightii on the natural enemies of D.
wrightii’s herbivores oppose the direct eﬀects of the tri-
chomes on those herbivores. These indirect eﬀects may
constrain the increase in the frequency of plants with
glandular trichomes in natural populations. Measure-
ments of plant ﬁtness in the ﬁeld in the presence and
absence of herbivores and/or natural enemies will be
emphasized. The successful candidate will participate
in planned ﬁeld and laboratory experiments and also
will have the opportunity to develop related projects.
Applicants must have a PhD. degree before hiring, and
research experience and knowledge in insect ecology
and behavior, the design and analysis of ﬁeld exper-
iments, insect identiﬁcation and a genuine interest in
the evolution of tritrophic interactions. Excellent oral
and verbal communication skills are also required.
Postdoctoral positions start at a salary of $31,044 per
year, plus beneﬁts. The starting date is negotiable but
will be no later than February 1, 2005. Screening of
applications will begin November 1, 2004. The initial
appointment will be for one year with reappointment
for up to two additional years contingent upon satisfac-tory performance. To apply, send a curriculum vitae,
relevant reprints or manuscripts in press, a description
of research interests within the Datura system, and the
names and e-mail and postal addresses of three refer-
ences to:

UEdinburgh ButterﬂySpeciation
A three year Leverhulme funded postdoc is available at
the University of Edinburgh.
You will carry out a study of the role of niche diver-
gence in the speciation of ithomiine butterﬂies. The
project will involve collecting ecological information on
microhabitat, ﬂight height and larval host plants for
two Ecuadorean communities of butterﬂies. A phyloge-
netic hypothesis will then be generated for the species
using nuclear and mitochondrial molecular sequence
data, and used to test for the correlated evolution of
mimicry and habitat use, and for the role of these traits
in causing speciation. You will have a PhD in a relevant
ﬁeld. Experience in comparative phylogenetic analysis,
molecular systematics and ecological ﬁeldwork would
all be desirable, although it is not expected that can-
didates will have experience in all of these areas. The
relative time spent on diﬀerent aspects of the project
will depend on the interests of the candidate.
This project is a collaboration with Keith Willmott at
the University of Florida and Eldredge Bermingham at
the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama

ULausanne EvolGenomics
Postdoctoral position: Evolutionary Genomics Univer-
sity of Lausanne, Switzerland
We are seeking a highly motivated postdoctoral re-
searcher who is interested in evolutionary genomics to
work on the analysis of genome sequence data of the ar-
buscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus intraradices. The
genome sequencing project on this fungus is currently
underway at the Joint Genome Institute (for general
project information see Martin F et al. 2004. New
Phytologist 161: 330-335) and it will provide the ﬁrst
genome sequence of a putative ancient asexual organ-
ism and will also be the ﬁrst genome of a eukaryotic
symbiont to be sequenced. Because of this, and also
because of the controversy about the origin and orga-
nization of genetic variation in these fungi, there are
many potentially exciting avenues of evolutionary re-
search using the genome sequence data. The success-
ful candidate should be completely familiar with up-to-
date computer based techniques for genome annotation,
assembly and analysis. He/she should also be able to
interact with the other group members who have lab-
based projects on evolution and population biology of
mycorrhizal fungi (see list of recent papers).
The successful candidate will be located in the Depart-
ment of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Lau-
sanne (Switzerland) and will be expected to collaborate
with the groups of the other steering committee mem-
bers situated in New Mexico State University, Michi-
gan State University, Oak Ridge National Laboratory,
University of Alabama, Cornell University, INRA Di-
jon (France), plus others. The Dept. of Ecology and
Evolution in Lausanne is situated on the shores of Lake
Geneva and provides a pleasant & exciting research en-
vironment comprising 17 diﬀerent research groups. A
genomics research centre has also been recently estab-
lished at the same site.
The position is initially for a one and a half year pe-
riod with the possibility of extension, depending on
performance. Starting date is negotiable. Applicantsshould contact Ian Sanders, Dept of Ecology and Evo-
lution, University of Lausanne, Switzerland. Email:

Post-doctoral position on genetics and evolution of
metabolic systems
A postdoctoral position is immediately available in
quantitative genetics/system biology in the group
Fundamental Quantitative Genetics (INRA-University
Paris XI-CNRS-INA PG) in Gif-sur-Yvette, France.
The project is part of a research program on the ge-
netic and evolution of metabolic systems. Metabolic
ﬂuxes are quantitative traits controlled by all enzyme
parameters genetically variable. In particular, enzyme
concentrations could play a key role in the variation
and evolution of such systemic variables, which are re-
lated to ﬁtness components and other complex traits.
Relying on the background of the metabolic control
theory, our laboratory has recently developed theo-
retical and experimental models of evolutionary op-
timization of ﬂuxes. The post-doc project will deal
with the eﬀect of selection on the ﬂux, using in vitro
reconstruction of metabolic pathways and experimen-
tal evolution approach: - Enzyme concentrations may
vary non-independently, due to competition and/or co-
regulation. As theoretically shown, the co-regulations
have an evolutionary cost, since they decrease the max-
imum possible ﬂux in a context of limited resources.
This prediction will be tested on glycolysis reconsti-
tuted in vitro, by varying enzyme concentrations ac-
cording to various models of co-regulations. - In or-
der to study the eﬀects of selection on the enzyme
concentrations and their correlations, yeast strains will
be cultivated on various sources of carbon. The vari-
ation of concentrations of glycolytic enzymes will be
followed over generations by quantitative proteomics,
and the glycolytic ﬂux and growth rate will be mea-
sured. Such information will shed light on the inﬂu-
ence of regulatory processes in evolution. Applicants
could have skills in any of several areas of evolution-
ary biology, biochemistry, system biology and/or ge-
netics. This position will be funded by the French
Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique for
one or two years, and is opened to non-French cit-

and Prof. Allen Moore, University of Manchester
A postdoctoral position is available to join a NERC-
funded project examining the consequences of mating
system structure on genetic architecture and reproduc-
tive isolation in Drosophila pseudoobscura. We are cur-
rently involved in an experimental evolution study in
which we have manipulated the mating system of this
naturally promiscuous species, by enforcing monogamy
and elevating promiscuity. These selection lines are be-
ing used to elucidate the adaptive signiﬁcance of sperm
heteromorphism (production of multiple sperm types
within a male) and the nature of sexual conﬂict in this
species.
We seek to complement these studies by quantifying
how mating system evolution inﬂuences the genetic ar-
chitecture of morphology and behavioural traits that
are relevant to reproductive success. This component
of the research will employ a quantitative genetics ap-
proach using a half-sib design to calculate additive ge-
netic (co)variances within and between the sexes and
to determine the relationship to mating system. We
will also determine the role of sexual selection and sex-
ual conﬂict in promoting reproductive isolation by ex-
amining pre- and post-copulatory success between and
within the selection lines having diﬀerent mating sys-
tems. The project will also take into account any eﬀects
of inbreeding by characterizing the eﬀect of selection on
genetic diversity using molecular markers.October 1, 2004 EvolDir 75
The Evolution and Behaviour group at Sheﬃeld has
been at the forefront of several recent developments
in evolutionary and behavioural ecology, including the
integration of mechanistic and functional approaches.
The postdoc would interact with this large group. Ad-
ditional interaction would occur with the Integrative
Animal Biology group at the University of Manchester,
members of which are experts in quantitative genetics.
Candidate requirements:
The desired candidate will have a strong background in
evolution, preferably quantitative behavioural genetics.
Applicants with experience in one ore more of the fol-
lowing will be preferred: microscopy, measurement and
dissection techniques; the use of microsatellites. Expe-
rience in Drosophila culturing is helpful but not essen-
tial. The project is based in Sheﬃeld and will require
some weekend work.

UAzores MarineMolMarkers Sep1-6
IMAR Institute of Marine Research (DOP-University of
the Azores) is organising the following workshop: “use
of molecular markers for the study of marine biodiver-
sity” from 1-6 September 2004and it will be held in
Horta (Azores).
This workshop is FREE OF CHARGE for students but
please, sort out your ﬂight and accomodation. For fur-78 EvolDir October 1, 2004
ther informations and applications, please contact Ser-
gio Stefanni at sstefanni@notes.horta.uac.pt
This workshop aims to lead PhD students and young
scientists through traditional and more up-to-date
methodology of analysing molecular data for the study
of marine biodiversity. This subject has become an im-
portant issue in the scientiﬁc community and the use of
molecular tools is of invaluable help. Therefore, with
this workshop, we gather together several world-leading
experts of marine molecular ecology to give a unique
opportunity to students to analyse their own datasets.
Seminars followed by tutorials should make the stu-
dents familiar with the use of designed software’s, and
the variety of subjects presented by the invited speakers
will cover a large spectrum of organisms inhabiting or
associated to the sea. Applicants are strongly advised
to bring their own datasets as they will analyse them
during the workshop. The selection of the candidates is
done to equally ﬁll each of the ﬁelds of expertise: marine
invertebrates (sea urchins, deep sea and hydrothermal
vents), ﬁsh, sea turtles, marine mammals and seabirds.
The structure of the workshop is as follows: In-
troduction to mathematical models and building
trees/networks techniques applied on molecular data
(sequences and microsatellites) Practical exercises on
specially prepared datasets for the students. Daily sem-
inars with practicals on the diﬀerent group of marine
or sea associated organisms. Small groups of students,
divided according to type of molecular markers used
in their projects, with the aim of analysing their own
datasets under the supervision of the related ﬁeld ex-
perts. Presentation of students’ work based on elabo-
ration of their own datasets is expected to conclude the
workshop.

ULisbon Phylogeography Oct22-23
Workshop:
The Workshop “THE QUATERNARY LEGACY -
Phylogeography and climatic changes in Southern Eu-
rope” will be held in Lisbon, in the Faculty of Science
of the University of Lisbon ( www.cba.fc.ul.pt/ ) in the
22nd and 23rd of October 2004. The oﬃcial language
of the Workshop is English.
The main theme concerns the role of the Southern Eu-
ropean Peninsulas in maintaining the genetic variability
by functioning as ice age faunal refugia, and the con-
sequent phylogeographic patterns that were generated
during the Quaternary climatic oscillations.
By organizing this meeting we are aiming to create a
discussion forum to solve impasses resulting from dif-
ferent points of view and as well to favour the devel-
opment of joint research programmes and collabora-
tions. The Scientiﬁc Programme includes talks by in-
vited speakers and poster presentations. Posters will
be displayed for two days during the meeting. Infor-
mation about the workshop: http://www.cba.fc.ul.pt/-

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only80 EvolDir October 1, 2004
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains one of the keywords
“Conference, Grad, Job, Other:, Postdoc, Workshop” and then the message stands a better chance of being
correctly parsed.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. So please do not expect an instant
response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
