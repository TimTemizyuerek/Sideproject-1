June 14, 2011.
The conference will feature over 20 scientiﬁc talks to
be given by alumni, collaborators, and friends of the
Abrahamson Lab. Topics will address the diversity of
subjects and approaches taken by Abe over his career,
from the ecology and evolution of plant-insect interac-
tions, to community and ecosystem approaches to ﬁre
ecology, restoration, and conservation of natural land-
scapes. Please visit the symposium website for a com-
plete list of speakers.
A contributed poster session is also planned. Activi-
ties will include a banquet, picnic, and talent show, as
well as regional natural history excursions (tentative).
Events will be held in the Elaine Langone Center on
the Bucknell Campus.
Anticipated costs include registration fees of $35 for
students and $75 for all others. These fees will include
meals and snacks but not lodging. Additional tickets to
the picnic and banquet will be available at cost. Regis-
tration is not currently active, but will be available in
February at the conference website.
Convenient lodging in Bucknell dormitories will beavailable for $38/ night single and $30/night double
occupancy, with a one-time key charge of $10. There
are many high-quality hotels, inns, and B&Bs in the
region as well.
The Bucknell University campus provides easy access
to the downtown shopping, dining, and entertainment
district of Lewisburg, a town noted for its historical
preservation and vibrant culture. Details can be found
at:http://www.lewisburgpa.com/ This conference will
celebrate Warren Abrahamson’s 38 years of service to
Bucknell University and the scientiﬁc community in an-
ticipation of his upcoming retirement in the summer of
2012. During his career, Abe has supervised approxi-
mately 200 undergraduate research students, 18 Mas-
ter’s recipients, and 21 postdoctoral fellows, many of
whom have remained active in science. In 2009 he was
named a AAAS fellow. His main research interests in-
clude 1) multitrophic plant-insect interactions using the
goldenrod system and 2) ﬁre ecology and plant demog-
raphy in Florida’s upland communities.

Munich DeepMetazoanPhylogeny
Oct11-14
Dear colleagues,
the international conference -Deep Metazoan Phy-
logeny 2011 -“ new data, new challenges?” will be held
from October 11-14, 2011 at the University of Munich
(Germany).
The conference will bring together mathematicians,
theoreticians, molecular systematists, and morpholo-
gists that aim at resolving deep branches in the animal
tree of life for a better understanding of the evolution
and diversiﬁcation of multicellular life on Earth.
During the conference, new data, new analytical tools
and new results will be discussed. Challenges and pit-
falls in phylogeny reconstruction based on molecular
and/or morphological data will be identiﬁed, aiming
for a critical and constructive view of the state of the
art of the metazoan tree of life.
The meeting will consist of sessions with several invited
leaders in the ﬁeld and open sessions with short presen-
tations. In addition, there will be ample space and time
to present posters.
The meeting focuses on three major themes: (1) Inno-
vations in the analyses of molecular and morphological
data Keynote speakers: to be announced
(2) Molecular phylogeny: new markers and phyloge-
nomic analyses Keynote speakers: Gert W¨ orheide (Uni-
versity of Munich): Introduction Herv ˜Ac/circlecopyrtPhilippe
(Universit ˜Ac/circlecopyrtde Montr ˜Ac/circlecopyrtal, Canada) (tentative):
Phylogenomics Dennis Lavrov (Iowa State University,
USA): Mitochondrial (phylo)genomics Kevin Peterson
(Dartmouth College, USA): microRNA’s as new molec-
ular markers three more keynote speakers to be an-
nounced
(3) The evidence found in morphology Keynote speak-
ers: Stefan Richter (University of Rostock): Introduc-
tion Chris Lowe (Stanford University) Ronald Jenner
(Natural History Museum London) Manfred Laubich-
ler (Arizona State University) Rudolf Loesel (Univer-
sity of Aachen) Thomas Bartolomaeus (University of
Bonn) Thomas Stach (Free University of Berlin)
There will also be a distinguished evening lecture by
Phil Donoghue (University of Bristol, UK): Reconcilia-
tion of fossils, molecules and morphology.The conference is organised by the Priority Program
“Deep Metazoan Phylogeny” of the German Science
Foundation (DFG). This program is a joint eﬀort of
more than 20 participating workgroups bringing to-
gether molecular, morphological and bioinformatic ex-
pertise with the goal to establish a (hopefully) robust
backbone metazoan phylogeny. Details on the priority
project “Deep Metazoan Phylogeny” can be found at
<http://www.deep-phylogeny.org >.
More information is available on the conference website
<www.palmuc.de/dmp2011 >, which will continuously

Dear EvolDir members,
We are pleased to announce the ESF-EMBO Sympo-sium ˆ aEPIGENETICS IN CONTEXT: FROM ECOL-
OGY TO EVOLUTIONˆ a, which will held on 18-23
September 2011 in Sant Feliu de Guixols in Spain.
The aim of this symposium is to bring together molecu-
lar epigeneticists with population geneticists and evolu-
tionary ecologists to discuss the potential contribution
of epigenetics to understanding ecological and evolu-
tionary responses of organisms (including humans) to
environmental change, to set ecological and evolution-
ary epigenetics on a strong theoretical and experimental
footing, and to start building a European network of re-
searchers, notably young scientists, that are interested
in this novel and exciting ﬁeld.
This is a medium-sized meeting limited to 150 partici-
pants, with talks by 20-25 invited speakers (see the list
of conﬁrmed speakers below), an equal number of short
talks selected from abstracts, and three poster sessions.
The conference will take place in a beautiful location,
and there will be plenty of time for discussion, exchange
of ideas and interaction between the participants.
Online application for the conference will be possible
from early next year through the ESF conference web-
site ( http://www.esf.org/conferences ). We particularly
encourage participation of students and early stage re-
searchers working in the ﬁeld. There will be some
means for ﬁnancial support of young researchers.
We are looking forward to seeing you in Spain!

Vienna Biocenter 11/12 April 2011
Call for Abstracts
Abstracts for Talks and Posters are invited for the 21st
annual MASAMB workshop which will come the ﬁrst
time to the continent and will be held at the Biocen-
ter in Vienna, Austria from the 11th to the 12th April
2011.
Bioinformatics and statistical genetics, twin themes of
the long-running series of annual MASAMB meetings,
have gained huge impetus from large-scale genome se-
quencing projects and development of high-throughput
biological assay systems, including gene-expression mi-
croarrays, next generation sequencing, proteomic and
metabolomic technologies. These immense data re-
sources, and the underlying complexities of molecular
and cell biology, provide exciting research opportunities
for numerate scientists.
With a strictly limited number of participants from
mathematics, statistics, computer science, bioinformat-
ics, biology and related ﬁelds, the MASAMB meet-
ings provide an intimate setting for exchange of ideas
in methodological and applied research. Research stu-
dents and scientists newly entering the ﬁeld of genomic
research are particularly welcome.

CambridgeU ButterﬂySpeciation
PhD project:
The role of sex pheromones in reproductive isolation
among Heliconius butterﬂies ±
Caroline Nieberding and Chris Jiggins
Heliconius is a diverse neotropical genus famous for
M1llerian mimicry, where unrelated species converge in
their aposematic colour patterns to more eﬃciently ad-
vertise their unpalatability to predators. Sister taxa
tend to belong to diﬀerent mimicry rings and evidence
suggests that shifts in colour pattern can cause both
pre- mating and post-mating isolation, thereby pro-
moting rapid speciation. These colour patterns are
therefore a clear example of an ecological trait with a
pleiotropic eﬀect on mate choice. However, pheromones
also play an important role in butterﬂy courtship [1-5]
but little is known about them in Heliconius.
Sex pheromones are essential chemical mediators be-
tween males and females and play key roles in deter-
mining i) the reproductive success, i.e. the ﬁtness ±, of
individuals within a species; and ii) reproductive iso-
lation between species [1]. This project aims to char-
acterise and explore the importance of pheromones in
Heliconius speciation.
Aims of the project We postulate that reproductive
isolation between sympatric related species of Helico-
nius must involve olfactory communication, especially
where such species share wing patterns due to mimicry.
We anticipate that females recognize conspeciﬁc mat-
ing partners based on the diﬀerentiation of male sex
pheromones (in composition, titres or ratios) used dur-
ing courtship, between closely related species.
Research methodology A. Role of male secondary sex-
ual structures in sex pheromone production
In Heliconius, male sex pheromones are produced by
a region of shiny androconial scales on the hindwing
known as androconia. To identify chemical compo-
nents produced by these wing regions we will com-
pare gas chromatographs (coupled to mass spectrome-
try) between males with surgically removed androconia
at emergence (hereafter operated ±males) compared to
sham-operated males, (following [5]). Potential male
sex pheromone components will be speciﬁc to sham-
operated males. This experiment will be performed fordiﬀerent sympatric Heliconius species.
B. Role of male sex pheromone components in the mat-
ing behaviour of Heliconius butterﬂies
Mating success of mixed populations can be measured
by tracking mating success via transfer of coloured
marker dusts from male to female during copulation
[6]. Competition experiments in tropical greenhouse
conditions between operated and sham-operated males
will determine whether the mating success of males is
dependent on the presence of androconia, and related
potential pheromone production. These experiments
could be carried out with diﬀerent races of Heliconius.
In further experiments, the active pheromone blend ob-
tained from total wing extracts, or from the correspond-
ing synthetic blend (if available for purchase or synthe-
sis), can be added to operated males in order to assess
whether pheromone restoration restores mating success.
C. Role of male sex pheromones in reproductive isola-
tion
Experiments could be carried out either in competi-
tion experiments, or through controlled mate choice
experiments involving fewer individuals. Comparison
between hybridisation rates of operated and sham-
operated males will be compared to investigate the role
of pheromones in reproductive isolation.
Alternatively, competition experiments between fe-
males of one population and males of diﬀerent co-
mimetic Heliconius species will be carried out with ei-
ther (i) females with antenna blocked with varnish, or
(ii) sham-operated females with varnish is deposited at
the base of the antenna. We expect that the proportion
of hybrid matings will be signiﬁcantly higher in the ﬁrst
than in the second set of experiments
In summary, little is known about pheromonal commu-
nication in Heliconius, so there is enormous scope for
this project to develop in diﬀerent directions. Possible
future avenues include studies of the genetic basis of
pheromonal diﬀerences between populations, or the in-
formation content of pheromonal signals within species.
The project is a collaboration between Chris Jig-
gins and the Butterﬂy Genetics Group in Cambridge,
UK and Caroline Nieberding in the Acadmie Louvain
(UCL), Belgium. Potential funding sources are avail-
able at both institutions. There is also potential for
collaboration with Luana Maroja, at Williams College,
and Mathieu Joron at the Natural History Museum in
Paris who are also beginning to explore pheromonal
communication in Heliconius. The project will also
beneﬁt from the fact that Prof. Brakeﬁeld has recently
moved to Cambridge, bringing considerable expertise10 EvolDir January 1, 2011
in butterﬂy evolutionary genetics and pheromonal com-
munication in particular.

A collaborative team of researchers from Colorado State
University, University of Nebraska and Cornell Univer-
sity seeks individuals to join us on a recently awarded
NSF Dimensions of Biodiversity grant called EVO-
TRAC (Evolutionary and Ecological Variability in Or-
ganismal Trait Response with Altitude and Climate).
EVOTRAC aims to predict the vulnerability of stream
organisms to climate change across latitudinal and el-
evation gradients by ﬁrst understanding how temper-
ature and disturbance shape stream biodiversity and
function. Through several integrated research ques-
tions, we will build links between multiple levels ofevolutionary, organismal and ecological biology using
a combination of ﬁeld surveys, in situ physiological tol-
erance measurements, and community/ecosystem scale
mesocosm and whole stream experiments.
To complete this highly integrative project, we are re-
cruiting several PhD students with strengths in one or
more of several areas (physiological ecology, aquatic in-
sect systematics, experimental ﬁeld ecology). We seek
students who are enthusiastic about working in remote
streams in Colorado and Ecuador, who speak Spanish,
and who are excited about interacting with a team of
principals from multiple universities and with interna-
tional collaborators.
Speciﬁcally we seek individuals with the following ex-

***Evolution of cooperation, communication and viru-
lence in microbes***
This project centres on two key themes in evolutionary
biology: the evolution of cooperation and the evolution
of virulence. These two themes combine strongly when
applied to microbial pathogens, as microbes must of-
ten cooperate, communicate and coordinate in order to
successfully exploit their hosts.
The Brown lab develops simple theoretical models
(rooted in evolutionary ecology and epidemiology) to
dissect the molecular, ecological and evolutionary inter-
plays of host-pathogen systems. We actively seek col-
laboration with experimentalists and bioinformaticians
to test our predictions and to discover new puzzles.
The project will speciﬁcally focus on one or two of the
following major challenges -
1) Understand the vital role that mobile genetic ele-
ments (molecular parasites of bacteria, such as plasmids
and temperate phages) play in driving the evolution of
microbial cooperative behaviours, antibiotic resistance
and virulence (e.g. ref 1).
2) Understand the complex multi-species social dynam-
ics (facilitation, competition) governing the establish-
ment, maintenance and transmission of pathogens in
the gut and nasopharynx (e.g. ref 2).
3) Understand the importance of the molecular and reg-
ulatory properties of public goods in shaping the evolu-
tion of microbial cooperation and communication (e.g.
ref 3).Across all of these challenges, a recurring theme is the
exploration of novel therapeutic strategies to exploit
our emerging understanding of microbial social life (ref
4).

ˆ aGenomics of Adaptation to Environmental Change of
an Ecologically Important Non-Model Aquatic Organ-January 1, 2011 EvolDir 13
ismˆ a
We are looking for a bright candidate for one PhD po-
sition associated with ARC Discovery funded project
DP110101207.
The successful applicant will have a strong interest
in population and evolutionary genomics/genetics
and natural history. She/he will join an interna-
tional team to study adaptation to environmental
change using next-generation ecological genomic
approaches. The position will be supervised
by Assoc Prof Luciano Beheregaray ˆ a Head of
the Molecular Ecology Lab ( www.bio.mq.edu.au/-
molecularecology/index.htm ) now based at Flinders
University (Adelaide) and by Prof Louis Bernatchez
ˆ a Director of the Canadian Research Chair in Ge-
nomics and Conservation of Aquatic Resources
(www2.bio.ulaval.ca/louisbernatchez/presentation.htm)
at Universit ˜Ac/circlecopyrtLaval (Quebec). The team also in-
cludes scientists from United States and other
Australian universities with experience in ﬁeld and
lab based research on natural selection, behavioural
ecology and biogeography. The position will be based
at Flinders and includes visits to the Bernatchez Lab
at Laval. The project will oﬀer opportunities to work
with novel genomic technologies, high throughput
genotyping, gene expression assays, and to conduct
ﬁeld work in eastern Australia.
Project summary Understanding whether natural pop-
ulations will be able to adapt to rapid environmental
change is a major research priority in the 21st cen-
tury. We will establish a program in ecological ge-
nomics to understand population adaptations and re-
sponses to environmental change in an ecologically im-
portant group of aquatic organisms. Powerful tools
will be used to assess functional genomic variation in
wild populations and under modiﬁed laboratory condi-
tions. This will enable us to pinpoint factors shaping
local adaptation over a large section of eastern Aus-
tralia and to assess the potential of populations to re-
spond to rapid environmental change. The ingenuity
to make this program successful is based on unique
features of our study system (e.g. replicated popula-
tions of two well-characterized rainbowﬁsh phenotypes
shaped by natural selection) and the connection with
an international team with leadership in synthesizing
next-generation sequencing data.
Application guidelines The ideal candidate will hold a
First Class Honours degree (or equivalent such as MSc)
and have prior experience in related research areas. The
PhD student will have input in ﬁeldwork and will be re-
sponsible for collection and analysis of gene expression
data and manuscript writing. Starting date is April2011 (this can be negotiated) and the annual full-time
stipend is AUD$22,500 tax-free. Applicants should e-
mail a letter (see below for address) summarizing re-
search interests and experience along with a CV in-
cluding the names, addresses and e-mails of three ref-
erees. IMPORTANT NOTE FOR INTERNATIONAL
STUDENTS: Flinders University has a very compet-
itive PhD scholarship program for non-domestic stu-
dents and only applicants with strong track record (i.e.
4 peer-reviewed publications or more) are encouraged
to apply.

ˆ aHistory, transport, or temperature: solving the riddle
of Australia’s temperate marine biodiversityˆ a
We are looking for bright candidates for two PhD posi-
tions to work on studies of connectivity of marine organ-
isms, associated with ARC Discovery funded project
DP110101275.
Project summary Understanding the forces driving
population connectivity in the sea, and the spatial and
temporal scales over which they operate, is a central
goal of marine ecology. Such knowledge is key for de-
veloping managementstrategies for ﬁsheries, and for de-
signing marine reserves that protect and enhance bio-
diversity.This study will address two issues of global
signiﬁcance: First, we will test the hypothesis that
oceanography(rather than historical isolation or tem-
perature alone) plays a key role in shaping population
connectivity.Second, we will reconcile the relative roles
of evolutionary (historical) and ecological (contempo-
rary) processesthat shape biodiversity in marine sys-
tems.Our proposal will address these issues using large-
scale population DNA datasets from multiple codis-
tributedspecies, powerful analytical tools in genetics
and oceanography, and computational modelling. The
uniquestudy-design proposed here capitalises on a sys-
tem of ˆ anaturally replicated laboratoriesˆ a (i.e. the east
vswestcoasts of Australia),

Graduate assistantship in Behavioral, Chemical, and
Evolutionary Ecology
Position Description: This is an NSF-funded project.
The Graduate Student will work with C. Schal (NCSU)
and A. Groot (NCSU, Max Planck Institute for Chem-
ical Ecology [MPICE] in Jena, Germany, and Uni-
versity of Amsterdam). In many moth species, male
pheromone is important for species-recognition and fe-
male acceptance of males. However, despite the recog-
nition that males invest disproportionately in the tis-
sues that produce these pheromones, their roles in ad-
vertising male quality and guiding female mate choice
have not been considered. This project addresses two
major questions: (a) How does natural variation in
close-range sexual signals aﬀect female choice in moth
species where the male pheromone resembles the fe-
male pheromone? and (b) Is the production of male
sexual signals linked to production of female signals in
these species? Speciﬁcally, the graduate student, work-
ing in collaboration with a postdoc, will: (1) chemically
identify the close-range male pheromones in two moth
species (fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda, and to-
bacco budworm Heliothis virescens), (2) quantify the
magnitude of between-strain intraspeciﬁc variation in
the male pheromones, and (3) evaluate what variable
features of the male pheromone contribute to female
choice.
Portions of this project will be conducted at the MPICE
and University of Amsterdam, providing a unique op-
portunity to be trained and conduct research in an in-
ternational collaborative setting.

Evolution of paternal care and infanticide by males in
mammals
Paternal care and infanticide by males lie at opposite
ends of a continuum of male behaviour towards infants.
Hypotheses to explain the evolution of paternal care
include enhanced oﬀspring survival, male reproductive
strategy to guarantee future mating opportunities or
to reduce sperm competition. These hypotheses make
diﬀerent predictions in relation to the conditions that
favoured the evolution of paternal care, such as cer-
tainty of paternity, mating system, ability of males to
monopolize receptive females, presence of alternative
strategies to secure paternity or simply the lack of al-
ternative mating opportunities. Likewise, infanticide
by males is supposed to enhance the likelihood of pa-
ternity of infanticidal males and its occurrence is pre-
dicted when females have relatively long lactation, are
polyestrous, reproduce aseasonally, and can be monop-
olized.
Studies on individual species found support for each
of these hypotheses but the generality of patterns and
the ultimate causes of paternal care and infanticide bymales remain elusive. How these behaviours associate
with and aﬀect maternal reproductive traits, such as in-
terbirth intervals, oestrous type, polyandry, have been
little investigated, and little is known about if and how
paternal care and infanticide by males are evolutionary
associated.
By using phylogenetic comparative methods and explic-
itly accounting for the species’ evolutionary history, this
project is the ﬁrst to comprehensively investigate the
evolution of paternal care and infanticide by males and
its implication for female reproduction in mammals.

in the Japanese morning glory, Ipomoea nil. I. nil is a
morning glory common in Mexico and adjoining regionsJanuary 1, 2011 EvolDir 17
and has spread via anthropogenic dispersal throughout
the world. It is a highly variable species and exhibits in-
teresting patterns of variation in life history traits. We
are carrying out greenhouse and garden experiments to
evaluate variation among these traits and evaluate spe-
ciﬁc hypotheses about life history variation. In addition
to evolutionary ecology investigations of this species,
we have ongoing research in phylogeography and the
systematics of Ipomoea nil and its relatives based on
sequence data from, in part, anthocyanin regulatory
genes.
Other research in our lab includes the systematics of
morning glories, molecular evolution of anthocyanin
pathway regulatory genes, phylogeography of morning
glory species, and additional studies in evolutionary
ecology. Our lab includes masters students, but also
an active group of undergraduate research assistants.
Teaching assistantships in our graduate program are
available for support.

1) Arctic climate change/Genomics/Ancient DNA
3 year PhD project in Australia and the Yukon Terri-
tory, Canada
A 3 year, ARC-funded PhD project is available at the
University of Adelaide, Australia. The project will
analyse genomic DNA extracted from frozen seeds and
bones preserved in Arctic permafrost for over 100,000
years to perform a detailed genetic analysis of how
plants and animals respond to climate change over short
time intervals. Speciﬁcally, we will ask whether the re-
sponse is to adapt genetically, or shift ranges - as is
generally assumed. We will use powerful new genomics
methods to generate unprecedentedly large amounts of
neutral and coding data, and apply advanced popula-
tion genetics analyses to perform the ﬁrst detailed anal-
ysis of how species adapt across time and space. This
project promises to provide unique views of the poten-
tial of plants and animals to adapt to climate change,
and the use of ancient samples to provide detailed views
of genomic evolution.
The project partners include Dr Grant Zazula (Yukon
Paleontologist), Prof Joe Cook (UNM), and Prof.
Charles Davis (Harvard).

UBarcelona GeneNetworkEvolution
Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona Department of Ge-
netics and Microbiology
We are looking for a student, preferably a biologists, to
start a PhD in systems biology and evo-devo about:
-Gene network simulation in pattern formation, mor-
phogenesis and morphological evolution.
One of the current challenges of evolutionary biologyJanuary 1, 2011 EvolDir 19
is to understand how genetic variation leads to spe-
ciﬁc morphological variation (the genotype-phenotype
map) and how that process aﬀects the direction of mor-
phological change in evolution. Our group is devoted
to address this question by using gene network mod-
els of pattern formation and morphogenesis in embry-
onic space. The idea, developped in previous work,
is that morphological variation arises as variation in
those developmental processes and that then by under-
standing those one can understand which morphological
variation is possible in each generation. The direction
of morphological change in evolution is determined by
both which morphological variation arises and which of
this variation is ﬁltered out by natural selection. Our
goal is to understand this process by making in silico
evolution of developmental gene networks able to pro-
duce pattern formation and morphogenesis (thus mor-
phological variation). This wil l also be applied to study
the evolution and development of speciﬁc mammalian
and Drosophila organs.
Programming skills or a willingness to acquire them are
required.
The grant is provided by the Spanish ministry of science
and innovation (4 years).

Reconstructing multi-species transmission networks for
Lyme disease pathogens using molecular forensics
Supervisory Team: Roman Biek, Robert W Furness
(Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health & Compara-
tive Medicine)
Lyme borreliosis (LB; Lyme disease’), caused by tick-
borne bacterial pathogens in the genus Borrelia, is the
most common vector-borne disease of humans in the
temperate zone. Wild birds and mammals constitute
the natural reservoir of Borrelia, which in northern Eu-
rope exists as four genospecies. Vertebrate host species
vary greatly in their ability to transmit the diﬀerent
genospecies and to support populations of the vector
tick, Ixodes ricinus. Deer, for example, support large
numbers of ticks per individuals but generally do not
transmit Borrelia. This variability in transmission com-
petence among host species has lead to a controversial
“dilution eﬀect” hypothesis, suggesting that pathogen
prevalence is reduced where host communities comprise
a large proportion of non-competent hosts. Variability
in transmission competence among hosts has also raised
concerns that environmental changes altering the com-
position of vertebrate communities could increase the
abundance of ti cks and risk of LB. The project will
exploit novel and powerful molecular tools to shed new
light on this debate. Genetic analysis can reliably re-
veal from which host species a tick acquired its last
blood meal. We will use this forensic approach to test
how the composition of natural host communities af-
fects tick feeding and infection patterns and thus op-
portunities for pathogen transmission and LB risk. A
signiﬁcant part of the study will focus on vertebrate
communities on islands containing a relatively small
and well-deﬁned set of vertebrate host species. The
study will test whether Borrelia prevalence in ticks de-
clines with the proportion of tick meals derived from
non-competent hosts as predicted by the “dilution ef-January 1, 2011 EvolDir 21
fect” hypothesis, and will use the relative proportions
of tick blood meals obtained from diﬀerent host species
to build empirical multi-species transmission networks,
essential for understanding the transmission cycles of
Borrelia and other tick-borne pa thogens. These models
will be used to explore the ability of diﬀerent host net-
works to maintain Borrelia in ticks. The student will re-
ceive training in molecular techniques, ecological ﬁeld-
work, and modelling techniques and will join a thriving
research group of ecologists, evolutionary biologists and
epidemiological modellers. The project also involves
research collaborators at other institutions (Macaulay
Institute - Scotland, INRA - France), creating further
opportunities for research training and networking.
Applied evolution: an experimental approach to inves-
tigating how the interaction between parasite life his-
tory strategies and control measures aﬀects rates of re-
sistance evolution
Supervisory Team: Barbara Mable (Institute of Bio-
diversity, Animal Health & Comparative Medicine),
Jan Lindstr¨ om (School of Life Sciences), Paul Johnson
(Robertson Centre for Biostatistics)
Resistance management is a key concern in human
and veterinary medicine and in agricultural produc-
tion systems. Although theoretical population genetics
models predict factors that might inﬂuence resistance
evolution in pathogens, potential interactions among
pathogen attributes (e.g. mating system, life history
traits, amount of gene ﬂow between resistant and sus-
ceptible genotypes) and speciﬁc control measures (e.g.,
frequency and dosage of chemical applications) remain
unclear. This study will take an experimental evolution
approach to understanding the inﬂuence of such inter-
actions on rates of resistance evolution, using nema-
todes as a model. Due to the diﬃculty of manipulating
parasites in wild hosts, resistance evolution previously
has been studied in the free-living but hermaphroditic
and selﬁng nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. How-
ever, since most parasitic nematodes are outcrossing,
this study will use Caenorhabditis remanei, whose mat-
ing system is more simila r to that of most parasitic
nematodes. The rate of evolution of resistance will be
evaluated by treating worms with anthelminthics, ap-
plied at diﬀerent dosages and rates, under experimen-
tally varied reproductive modes and population demo-
graphics. The project is by nature interdisciplinary
and the student will receive training in a wide range
of approaches, including experimental design, statisti-
cal analyses, experimental evolution, life history and
population genetics

Course: Erasmus Mundus Joint Master in Evolutionary
Biology (MEME)
MEME is a two-year research oriented master pro-
gramme for talented and motivated students who are
interested in understanding evolution in all its facets.
The MEME programme will address the driving forces
of evolution at all levels of organismal organisation
(from cells and individuals to populations and ecosys-
tems), and it will allow students to study all kinds of or-
ganisms (microorganisms, plants, animals) in all kinds
of habitats (marine as well as terrestrial) with a diver-
sity of approaches (ﬁeld, lab, theory). The focus of the
programme is not only on how evolution shaped life on
our planet in the past, but also on how understanding
the principles underlying evolution can provide
new insights and help to cope with present-day chal-
lenges in a variety of ﬁelds, including ecology, epi-
demiology, physiology, immunology, genetics/genomics,
bioinformatics, economics and the social sciences.
Only few universities in the world would be able to oﬀer
a programme of such broad scope without compromis-
ing scientiﬁc quality. For this reason, four European
universities:
- University of Groningen (Netherlands)
- University of Montpellier II (France)
- Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich (Germany)
- Uppsala University (Sweden)
have joined forces with Harvard University (USA).
Together, this consortium is able to put together an at-
tractive multidisciplinary programme that meets high-
est standards. All students have to study at at least
two partner universities, and they will receive either a
joint MSc degree from the whole consortium or double
degrees from two partner universities.

UNeuchatel LymeDiseaseEvolution
PhD positions in Ecology & Evolution of Lyme disease
Department of Biology, University of Neuchˆ atel
Two PhD positions are available for research on the
ecology and evolution of Lyme disease, which is caused
by the bacteria, Borrelia burgdorferi, and is transmit-
ted among vertebrate hosts by Ixodes ticks. There are
three major areas of research: (1) Climate change is
predicted to alter the spatial and temporal distribution
of ticks. Changes in the timing of seasonal tick activity
patterns will have dramatic consequences for the ecol-
ogy and evolution of the Lyme disease system. We plan
to use an experimental evolution approach to test how
diﬀerent climate change scenarios would aﬀect the evo-
lution of B. burgdorferi. (2) Critical for understanding
the ecology of any disease are estimates of host-parasite
encounter rates and estimates of the parasite’s eﬀect on
the host’s vital rates (survival and reproduction). We
plan to use ﬁeld-based surveys and experiments to es-
timate these parameters under natural conditions. (3)
Ticks host a community of microorganisms with con-
ﬂicting modes of transmission. We are interested in
investigating the interactions between vertically and
horizontally transmitted microorganisms and the tick
immune system. The University of Neuchˆ atel has a
strong group of parasitologists that study host-vector-
pathogen interactions across a wide range of biological
organization (molecular biology, physiology, and evolu-
tion and ecology).Job requirements: The position requires an indepen-
dent, highly motivated, enthusiastic, and scientiﬁcally
curious individual with a strong background in ecol-
ogy, evolutionary biology, or related ﬁelds. Molecular
techniques, ﬁeld experience, and statistical data analy-
sis skills are all highly useful. The applicant must have
a Master’s degree. The position requires teaching of
undergraduate biology labs in French so French proﬁ-
ciency is required.
Start data: One position is available as early as Jan-
uary 1, 2011, the other on June 1, 2011. Starting dates
are ﬂexible and I will wait for outstanding candidates.
Salary is determined by the Institute of Biology.
Application requirements: Formal applications should
include: (1) a 1-2 page cover letter indicating re-
search interests, (2) your CV (including a list of pub-
lications), and (3) two letters of reference. Informal
enquiries and formal can be submitted by email to:

TOOL USE AND CULTURE IN WILD NEW CALE-
DONIAN CROWS
PROJECT DESCRIPTION The New Caledonian crow
(Corvus moneduloides) is endemic to a remote, trop-
ical island in the South Paciﬁc, where it habitually
uses tools for extracting invertebrate prey from dead-
wood and vegetation. New Caledonian crows exhibit a
remarkable degree of behavioural sophistication: they
manufacture at least three diﬀerent tool types (includ-
ing the most sophisticated animal tool yet discovered);
they can modify and combine tools to achieve a goal;
and they have even been observed inventing new tool
designs to solve novel problems. Perhaps most intrigu-
ingly, it has been suggested that wild New Caledo-
nian crows may progressively reﬁne their tool technol-
ogy through culturally accumulating innovations – a
phenomenon hitherto believed to be uniquely human.
Most research to date has focused on the species cogni-
tive abilities and on mapping natural variation in tool24 EvolDir January 1, 2011
morphology, but the evolutionary, ecological and social
context of these birds unusual tool-use behaviour re-
mains poorly understood. This PhD project will chart
the ecology and behaviour of wild, free-ranging crows,
using detailed ﬁeld observations, systematic surveys,
and a suite of novel biologging technologies (includ-
ing animal-borne video cameras). In addition, speciﬁc
hypotheses will be examined in controlled experiments
with wild and captive crows (the latter will be kept for
brief periods of time in ﬁeld aviaries). Taken together,
this observational and experimental research will pro-
duce a much clearer picture of the ecological signiﬁcance
of crow tool use, and its possible cultural underpin-
nings. This PhD project oﬀers exciting opportunities
for a keen ﬁeld biologist: to conduct topical research on
animal tool use and culture in a high-proﬁle study sys-
tem; to join an established, well-funded ﬁeld research
project; to receive training in state-of-the-art ecological
research techniques; and to join a young and dynamic
research group at Oxford University (head: Dr Chris-
tian Rutz).
ESSENTIAL SELECTION CRITERIA – excellent aca-
demic track record – demonstrable skill and enthusi-
asm for ﬁeldwork – ability and willingness to live and
work for extended time periods under challenging ﬁeld
conditions (e.g., lone work, research in remote rainfor-
est sites, diﬃcult weather conditions) – conversational
knowledge of French, or willingness to learn the lan-
guage – clean driving licence, and good driving skills –
ability to obtain a visa for research in New Caledonia
(French overseas territory)

UOxford EvolutionaryEcology
PhD studentship in Evolutionary Ecology
ADMIXTURE, GENETIC DIVERSITY AND THE
EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS OF COLONIZATION
Species introduced to locations outside of their native
range provide outstanding opportunities to study eco-
logical and evolutionary processes. For example, in-
troduced populations frequently encounter novel envi-
ronments, which enable us to disentangle the genetic
and non-genetic factors that promote rapid evolution
of adaptation.
At ﬁrst sight, rapid adaptation to non-native environ-
ments may seem paradoxical since a response to selec-
tion should be constrained by the loss of genetic diver-
sity typically associated with population bottlenecks.
Admixture - the mixing of genotypes from diﬀerent
source populations - could be a solution to this paradox
by increasing genetic and phenotypic diversity, reducing
inbreeding depression, and thus enhancing the oppor-
tunity for evolution. Admixture could therefore cause
rapid divergence of introduced populations from their
ancestral source. Yet, to what extent admixture occurs
in introduced species and the consequences thereof re-
main poorly understood.
Using a system of >25 populations of the wall lizard
(Podarcis muralis) that have been introduced north of
their native distribution, and their source populations
in southern Europe, this project will test: (i) for diﬀer-
ences in genetic diversity between native (source) and
introduced populations; (ii) how these patterns are af-
fected by the number of founders, their origin(s), and
admixture of distinct genotypic lineages; and (iii) to
what extent admixture - in combination with natural
and sexual selection - contributes to the observed phe-
notypic divergence between native and introduced pop-
ulations.
This DPhil project provides exciting opportunities
to develop a research career in evolutionary ecol-
ogy by combining ﬁeld, molecular, and experimen-
tal approaches to study the origin and evolution ofJanuary 1, 2011 EvolDir 25

UQueensland OctupusEvolution
PhD opportunity commencing in 2011
This will be the ﬁrst study to comprehensively exam-
ine the full taxonomical and biochemical breadth of
coleoid venoms. Research will include the ﬁrst ever
comparison of the convergent strategies between Arctic
and Antarctic endemic fauna for adaptation to subzero
temperatures. Central to the project will be the char-
acterisation of bioactivities of the crude venoms and
puriﬁed toxins. This will be accomplished by combin-
ing proteomic and genomic approaches. Novel small
venom peptides will be investigated as potential lead
candidates for drug design and development. The mul-
tidisciplinary nature of venom research necessitates a
collaborative approach that taps into expertise across
a wide range of scientiﬁc disciplines. Thus, funding is
available for travel to collaborators laboratories in Aus-
tralia and overseas and for ﬁeldwork in locations such
as at the University of Queensland research station on
Heron Island in the Great Barrier Reef. The results will
help us to understand protein evolution, will cast light
on the classic problem of how venom systems evolve,
and may provide leads in the search for commercially-
exploitable venom peptides. An extensive array of sam-
ples are already assembled, including over 200 samples
of Antarctic octopuses. Additional samples will be ﬁeld
collected during the project and a live research collec-
tion will also be maintained by the student.
The student will be based within the University of
Queenslands Department of Biological Sciences under
the primary supervision of Dr. Bryan Grieg Fry, with
co-supervision by Professor Richard Lewis at the Insti-
tute for Molecular Bioscience. A 5K top-up scholarshipwill be oﬀered to the student who successfully obtains
a PhD scholarship.

URochester InsectEvolGenetics
Opportunities for graduate research are available in my
laboratory to study evolutionary genetics and genomics
of insects and their microorganisms. Our broad goals
are to understand (a) how complex traits (e.g. behav-
ior, development, gene regulation) evolve at the genetic
level, and (b) the role of bacterial symbioses in shap-
ing evolution of eukaryotes. Our primary study organ-
isms are the emerging genetic model system Nasonia (a
small and laboratory tractable parasitoid insect) and
bacterial associates of insects (e.g Wolbachia and Ar-
senophonus).
This is a particularly exciting time in my laboratory
as both Nasonia and symbiosis are rapidly growing as
research areas, and this presents special opportunities
for motivated individuals to contribute to an emerging
ﬁeld. Nasonia, a genus composed of four closely re-
lated species, is an excellent genetic model for studies
of complex traits and evolutionary genetics of specia-
tion. Active current projects include identiﬁcation and
cloning of quantitative trait loci (QTL) involved in be-
havioral and developmental diﬀerences between species,
studies of epigenetic inheritance (DNA methylation and
genome imprinting), and investigations of the role of
nuclear-mitochondrial interactions in hybrid incompat-
ibility. Our research on microbial symbioses focuses on
two basic questions. First, we wish to determine to
what extent lateral gene transfers from bacteria to eu-
karyotes results in acquisition of novel gene functions.
Second, we are investigating how bacteria-host interac-
tions co-evolve, and whether these interactions promote
genetic divergence and speciation of hosts.

newer tools of genomics to bear on the fundamental
question of origins and maintenance of biodiversity.
Current areas of research include:
- Contemporary evolution associated with climate
change and biological invasion. - The genetic basis
of ecologically important traits. - The role of selec-
tion and drift in shaping the genome. - The role of
mutation-selection balance in sexual selection and the
evolution of sex. - Functional and genomic analyses of
host-pathogen systems. - Genomic analyses of adaptive
evolution, from the molecular to population levels.
The evolutionary and ecological genetics group re-
sides within a larger, three campus, Graduate De-
partment of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (links
here) composed of 60 faculty. EEB is home to a
broad and collegial group of ecologists, systematists,
geneticists, behavioural ecologists, and evolutionary bi-
ologists. Many projects are conducted at the uni-
versity’s ﬁeld station which is dedicated to ecological
and evolutionary research (The Koﬄer Scientiﬁc Re-
serve, www.ksr.utoronto.ca ). Genomic analyses are
supported by the Centre for the Analysis of Genome
Evolution and Function ( www.cagef.utoronto.ca ).
Toronto is a vibrant, multicultural city on the shore of
Lake Ontario, with rich cultural options in the arts, mu-sic and ﬁlm, ethnic cuisine and a high quality of life. In

PhD studentship, Evolution of Human Social Cognition
(Utrecht University, The Netherlands)
Applications are invited for a funded four-year PhD
position on the evolution of human social cognition,
based at Utrecht University (The Netherlands). The
project forms part of a large multi-disciplinary collabo-
ration that is investigating the contribution of diﬀerent
research ﬁelds to the understanding of the human mind.
This research programme, made up of ten sub-projects,
will hire seven PhD students and two postdoctoral fel-
lows in total.
Sub-project description: This project will investigate
the combined roles of cultural and genetic evolution in
shaping human social cognition, ethics, and norms. It
will also investigate the assumptions of current evolu-
tionary approaches to understanding human behaviour,
and the way in which public discussions and opinions
of human nature are informed by popular accounts of
evolutionary biology and cognitive neuroscience. We
envisage the work to involve theoretical models of gene-
culture co-evolution, combined with experimental stud-
ies investigating the assumptions and predictions of28 EvolDir January 1, 2011
these models. Experimental and survey work will inves-
tigate how popular reports of research on the evolution
of human cognition inﬂuence public attitudes to science
and to society. The precise approach taken will depend
on the interests and background of the PhD candidate.
Requirements: MA or MSc in biology, psychology, an-
thropology or philosophy, or a related discipline, with
a clear interest in human cognition and evolution.
The successful candidate will be appointed at the

I am seeking a highly motivated and enthusiastic MS
student to work on a federally-funded project evaluat-
ing alternative culling strategies for bison herds, begin-
ning fall 2011. The goal of this project is to develop an
individual-based population model to evaluate cullingstrategies to determine which strategy best preserves
genetic variation over the long term. Qualiﬁed candi-
dates should be broadly interested in the evolution, con-
servation, and management of vertebrate populations,
and should have experience and interest in combining
computer modeling, population genetics, and wildlife
ecology. Funding in the form of assistantships, research

WakeForestU
ExperimentalEvolutionaryGenomics
Graduate position: Wake.Forest.U.ExperimentalEvolutionaryGenomics
A PhD position is available in the lab of Cliﬀord Zeyl in
the Department of Biology at Wake Forest University to
study the genomes of evolving yeast populations under
selection for invasive growth, a trait associated with vir-
ulence in clinical strains and species of yeast.The study
will bring together experimental evolution, in which mi-
crobial adaptation is directly observed under known, re-
producible conditions, and the speed with which yeast
genomes can now be sequenced and analyzed.Short and
long-term selection will be applied to genetically diver-
gent ancestral populations for which the sequence poly-
morphisms that inﬂuence invasive growth have been
identiﬁed.Genomic analysis of evolved populations will
then reveal how well the evolutionary outcomes could
be predicted from knowledge of the ancestral genomes,
and how contingent longer-term adaptation is on their
initial evolutionary steps.
The project is a collaboration with Dr. Paul Magwene
at Duke University, a 90-minute drive east of Wake
Forest University, whose lab will perform the genome
sequencing and sequence analysis.It is funded through
summer 2013 by an NSF grant, with additional sup-
port through teaching assistantships guaranteed by the
department.
Applicants must have a bachelor’s degree in biology
(masters preferred), with some background in evolu-
tionary or population genetics.A keen interest in the
broad questions and hypotheses of evolutionary biology,
and in testing them experimentally, are essential.Lab
bench skills in basic molecular biology and microbiol-
ogy would be an asset but are not required.

CNRS France EvolutionaryBiology
Dear all
[please distribute as appropriate; sorry for cross-
posting]
This is to inform you about an attractive job oﬀer
in France - the yearly announcement of researcher
positions ﬁnanced by the French Funding Organiza-
tion “Centre National de la Recherche Scientiﬁque”
(CNRS). These are *life-time 100 % research* positions
oﬀered in an international competition to excellent can-
didates. The web page is http://www.dgdr.cnrs.fr/-
drhchercheurs/concoursch/default-en.htm .
DEADLINE for the full application is January, 6. Po-
tential host labs should be contacted very soon (see
below). Knowing FRENCH is not required for apply-
ing.
THE PROFILES: Posts of interest for ecologists and
evolutionary biologists are available, mainly in sections
20 and 29 and to some degree 43 and 45. In some
cases, proﬁles are quite speciﬁc (such as “Amazonian
biodiversity”, “Evolution of Symbioses”). But very
strong candidates that have little to do with a spe-
ciﬁc proﬁle may in cases be preferred over weak candi-
dates that perfectly match that proﬁle. Moreover, most
proﬁles are not speciﬁc and just suggest the candidate
should match the themes of the corresponding section.
Themes of section 20 are given on http://www.cnrs.fr/-
comitenational/sections/section20.htm (in French, in-
cluding Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning / Land-
scape ecology and ecology of species communities / Eco-
toxicology and molecular ecology/ Impacts of global
change on ecosystems and hydrosystems, paleoceology
and continental paleoenvironments, as well as a number
of non-ecological geosciences issues). Themes of section
29 are given on http://www.cnrs.fr/comitenational/-
sections/section29.htm (in French, but including every-
thing on biodiversity, evolutionary biology, molecular
biology and ecology, from ecophysiology, behavior, life
histories via populations, host-parasites, to communityJanuary 1, 2011 EvolDir 35
assembly). Themes of section 43 are given on http://-
www.cnrs.fr/comitenational/cid/cid43.htm (in French,
but including modeling of dynamics of biological sys-
tems at all levels and population dynamics; see also the
post N43/03 a bioinformaticien post already reserved
for ECOBIO lab at Rennes). Themes of section 45
are given on http://www.cnrs.fr/comitenational/cid/-
cid45.htm (in French, but including interaction between
man and global change and biota).
Multiple candidatures are possible.
THE TYPES OF POSTS (see also http://-
www.dgdr.cnrs.fr/drhchercheurs/concoursch/-
chercheur/default-en.htm, including salaries): There
are “charg´ es de recherche”, 2nd and 1st degree, 2nd
and 1st degree “directeurs de recherch´ e”, i.e. Associate
Scientists after dissertation and after some years of
postdoctoral experience, and Senior Scientists after
about 8 or more years years of experience, respectively.
*However*, please note that the announced posts of
“directeurs de recherche” do not seem to exist (except
in the case of very exceptional applications). These
“posts” are de facto only for promotion of people
that already have a position of a charg´ e de recherche
within CNRS. According to my experience already the
Charg´ es de Recherche are actually free to do what
they want within an overall, very large disciplinary
category (see above). Starting salaries are generally
OK for feeding a family of three, even though it may
become tight in Paris.
The competition for such positions is becoming increas-
ingly tough, in particular in the section 29. Even
though strange things are happening, in section 29 mul-
tiple ﬁrst or senior authored publications per year each
with an impact factor of 4 or more seem to be use-
ful, and Nature, Science, PNAS, Ecology Letters are
highly appreciated. Further criteria (in French) are
given for each section e.g. at http://www.cnrs.fr/-
comitenational/sections/critere/section29.htm .
THE RECRUITMENT PROCEDURE. Applications
include a full research project. A visit to the lab af-
ter having submitted the application seems to be very
much expected in all cases. Generally, French institu-
tions may not reimburse candidates the travel costs to
visit labs or to come to interviews etc.. We should have
some funds here at Rennes. After having applied there
is a risk that *all* eligible candidates will be invited to
a presentation and an interview in Paris in spring 2011.
Travel costs will *not* be reimbursed by the CNRS, but
there might be funds at the

tic about working in remote streams in Colorado and
Ecuador, who speaks Spanish, and who is excited about
interacting with a team of principle investigators from
multiple universities and with international collabora-
tors.
Speciﬁcally we seek an individual with the following
qualiﬁcations and expertise: >MS or PhD in ecology,
evolution, or a related discipline. >Demonstrated lead-
ership skills, with experience coordinating a large and
diverse ﬁeld crew. >Excellent communication and in-
terpersonal skills. >Fluency in spoken and written
Spanish and English. >Experience managing and in-
tegrating diverse types of ﬁeld, genetic, and experimen-
tal data using relational databases. >Strong inter-
est in being involved in data collection, analysis, and
manuscript preparation. >Willingness to work in re-
mote streams and ﬁeld sites in Ecuador and Colorado
for prolonged periods (weeks to months). >Excellent
problem solving skills and resilience for dealing with
unpredictable challenges that arise during ﬁeldwork. >
Basic knowledge of vehicle maintenance and mechanics.

Evolution practical exercise answers
Dear all,
At the end of last week I posted a message asking for
ideas for Evolution practicals. Judging from the re-
sponse I got this is something a lot of people would like
to share more information on, and teaching Evolution
in general.
* Sarah Stockwell sent a link to a list she has
assembled which has a lot of interesting ideas http:/-
/sarahstockwell.wordpress.com/teaching/ * Peter
Roessingh suggested using the computer practical
Evolutionlab http://www.biologylab.awlonline.com/-
index.html * Andrew Crawford suggested I read Frey
& Lively (2010), Evolution: Education and Outreach,
Vol 3, pp 114-120. This journal has free access until
31st Dec, so may be worth looking through for other
aspects of teaching Evolution. * Sujal Phadke sug-
gested using the computerised simulation popgen and
also sent 3 links http://www.biologyinmotion.com/-
evol/index.html http://www.biologycorner.com/-
worksheets.html http://www.thatsevolution.com/
* Amr Aswad suggested looking at selection for C.
elegans to learn to avoid pathogenic bacteria. * Sean
Werle suggested getting students to make a squash
of polytene chromosomes http://people.umass.edu/-
swerle/reprints/Werle etal2004.pdf * Henry Schaﬀer
suggested using Drosophila, students cross Drosophila
and count the progeny in order to estimate the
heritability of a recessive lethal allele, which also
gives heterozygote advantage. He says that he
then asks the students to plug their estimates
into http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/course/gn412/select-
sb.html, then click on “Plot values”. There is
some background and discussion for the instructor
is at http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/gn/ex/select-sb-
disc.html He also suggested this exercise on drift
http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/gn/ex/mit- eve.html *56 EvolDir January 1, 2011
Christophe Boete suggested these 2 websites http:/-
/evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evohome.html and
http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/educators/-
index.html * I decided that I would get students to
investigate sexual selection for hissing and agonistic be-
haviours in hissing cockroaches, as this model includes
aspects of female choice and male-male competition.
Thank-you for all your suggestions and I hope others
ﬁnd this list useful,

Macclade Alternatives answers
Many thanks to everyone who replied to my earlier post
seeking a windows alternative to MacClade for teaching
systematics in intro bio labs. I received over 2 dozen
replies within 24 hours. Several folks asked me to post
a summary of the replies.
Over 90% suggested Mesquite, which is a JAVA
based program also written by the Maddisons (the
authors of MacClade) Information on mesquite is
available here http://mesquiteproject.org/mesquite/-
mesquite.html Steve Jordan at Bucknell (see 1st post
below) has general instructions on Mesquite for his in-
tro bio students that folks are welcome to check out.
A selection of the replies I got is below:
—–
I was faced with this same problem several years ago,
and found Mesquite to be a good alternative. We’ve
used Mesquite to teach systematics labs now to hun-
dreds of students on PCs and Macs without any major
problems. A nice aspect of Mesquite is the fact that it
is platform-independent, so the instructions can be vir-
tually identical for PC or Mac users. It is also freeware.
Here is a link to our lab website. The labs that use
Mesquite are numbers 3 and 4. Feel free to use or mod-
ify these if you’d like.

you tried PAUP (licensed) or PHYLIP (free)? Birgit
I think there is a windows program called CLADOS
that does the same thing as MacClade does. I have not
used in a long time.
was going to suggest mesquite which is free & avail-
able on windows. there is also used a web-based pro-
gram, swami – http://www.ngbw.org/ .hope you are do-
ing well-
I used to use WinClada.
That still might work.
Please let me know if you ﬁnd something better.
I am pretty sure the exercise could be done in R (which
is free), just not conﬁdent about calculating CI val-
ues in R since I have not done it. There is an ex-
cellent resource also about how to do many phyloge-
netic analyses/manipulations in R located here: http:/-
/www.r-phylo.org/wiki/HowTo Table ofContents Us-
ing R would also be a great way to introduce students
to command line coding software, which is a really valu-
able skill.
I would recommend MEGA for doing cursory align-
ments and tree constructions on a PC. http://-
www.megasoftware.net/ I’m not sure about swapping
branches in MEGA but it may be easy to import a tree
from MEGA into another tree viewing program such as
FigTree.

MacClade teaching alternatives
Hello,
I’m looking for recommendations for windows-based al-ternative to MacClade for teaching purposes. We teach
an intro bio lab on systematics in which students com-
plete a matrix of roughly 10 characters x 10 species and
then use MacClade to manually swap branches around
and see how that aﬀects tree metrics like length & CI.
Unfortunately the current computer labs available for
this exercise are all Windows machines, and so we need
to come up with an alternative program. Ideally the
program should be able to input a character matrix,
produce a tree, and let the students swap branches and
see how that alters the # transitions per trait and over-
all CI of the tree.
If anyone has a suggestion, please let me know.
Thanks, Sarah

MarineEvolution ASSEMBLE call
Dear EVOLDIR colleagues,
ASSEMBLE is an EU FP7 research infrastructure
project comprising a network of marine research sta-
tions, as listed below. We oﬀer on-site and remote ac-
cess for European research groups to conduct marine
research projects, including projects that focus on evo-
lutionary biology using marine models.
The 4th ASSEMBLE call to apply for access to marine
infrastructure is now open:
- Deadline Feb 15, 2011 - For on-site access projects
taking place between June and November 2011 (remote
access can be applied for all year around). - Support
cover travel and up to an overall total of 60 person days
of accommodation and infrastructure usage for up to 3
users. For IUI (Eilat) such support is limited to 1 or
2 users for up to 30 person days per user. - Only Eu-
ropean user groups (=user group leader and majority
of the users working in Member States or Associated
States) can apply and only to ASSEMBLE sites out-
side their own country. - Applicants working outside
Europe (EU Member states and Associated states) can
be funded if not being the main applicant and if in mi-58 EvolDir January 1, 2011

Promoting Local Evolution Societies
The Society for the Study of Evolution (SSE) and The
European Society of Evolutionary Biology (ESEB) an-
nounce a joint venture to facilitate the global growth
of evolution as a discipline. In order to encourage the
establishment and growth of local societies with a clear
interest in evolutionary biology, SSE and ESEB will
oﬀer free access to our journals, Evolution and Jour-
nal of Evolutionary Biology, respectively, to individual
(and not institutional) members of regional or national
biology, evolution, genetics, and ecology societies in de-
veloping countries or regions. To be eligible for the free
access, such a local society must already have or demon-
strate the ability to develop clear mission statements,
eﬀective organizational structures, regular meetings, a
society website, and member dues, and veriﬁable active
membership lists. This is a limited time oﬀer which
will be granted and extended on a case by case basis.
We deﬁne developing regions as outside North Amer-
ica, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Japan
and parts of the Middle East. SSE and ESEB are also
open to suggestions for other initiatives that will help
grow evolution societies in developing regions.

PuertoRico
RhesusMonkeyVolunteer
Rhesus monkey research on Cayo Santiago, Puerto
Rico.
We are looking for a volunteer to assist on a project
examining kin recognition on a semi free-ranging rhe-
sus macaque population on Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico
(USA). The project is being undertaken in the Lab
of Prof. Dr. Anja Widdig and Dr. Dana Pfeﬀerle
(Leipzig University & Max Planck Institute for Evo-
lutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany; see http:/-
/www.eva.mpg.de/pks/index.html ) The volunteer will
work alongside Dr. Pfeﬀerle ( http://www.eva.mpg.de/-
pks/staﬀ/pfeﬀerle/ ).
The successful applicant will be expected to work on
Cayo Santiago for 5-6 days a week, and may also be re-
quired to undertake data entry and/or processing in the
later afternoon and early evenings. On Cayo Santiago,
the primary task will be to assist carrying out playback
experiments as well as to help recording rhesus macaque
vocalizations. In order to do so, appropriate training
will be provided. D. Pfeﬀerle is also happy to explain
analyses procedures that ultimately will take place on
collected data. This position is ideal for graduate stu-
dents or recent graduates looking to gain experience in
ﬁeldwork and data collection.
We prefer applicants that stay for the entire period of
6 month. However, in the case of two very good appli-
cations (and only in this case!), a split into two times
three months is possible. In your application please
state the maximum time period you can stay.
Applicants should have a Bachelor in Biology, Ecology,
Animal Behavior, Physical Anthropology, Primatology,
or a related ﬁeld. Previous ﬁeld experiences (preferably
in the tropics) and knowledge of Spanish is helpful, but
not necessary. In general, carrying out playback exper-
iments can be a protracted and patience challenging
task, including many hours of waiting for the correct
situation. Thus you must be able to maintain a posi-
tive attitude. Applicants also must be in good physical
and mental condition; feel comfortable being far away
from family and friends; be emotionally mature, ener-
getic, and very patient; have an excellent eye for detail;
dont be afraid of approaching monkeys (!); willing towork in a small team setting and follow instructions; be
able to maintain a positive and humorous attitude to-
wards challenging and tiring work. Although the work
can be demanding and tiring, being close to habituated
primates is very rewarding and a great experience.
The language in our team is English. The successful
candidate must have medical insurance, a valid IACUC
certiﬁcate ( www.citiprogram.org ) and will have to pro-
vide medical test in order to be allowed to work on
Cayo Santiago (information will be provided after ac-
ceptance).
Support can be provided for housing (depending on
sharing the house cost currently range between 185 and
350 US$) and visa if needed. Depending on whether
you stay for a 3- or 6-month period, your experience and
performance, support for your ﬂight and transportation
from and to the airport might also be provided. How-
ever volunteers have to cover the expenses for: medical
insurance, medical tests required to work on Cayo San-
tiago, ﬁeld clothes and personal expenses.
Term of Appointment: >From June 20th 2011 till De-
cember 20th 2011.
Application Deadline: Target application date is Jan-
uary 31st 2011, but open until a suitable candidate has
been found.
Comments: To apply, candidates should email a brief
cover letter outlining their interests, experience, and
why they wish to undertake work on the project. They
should attach a CV that includes at least contact details
of two academic reference. If asked, it will be the re-
sponsibility of candidates that academic references are

SAMOVA CrashesAfterInput
Hi
I have been trying to run a SAMOVA analysis
(SAMOVA 1.0). The input ﬁles appear to be read OK
and the log ﬁle even says that the program has made
a successful run. However, at some point prior to the
ﬁnal output ﬁles being dumped, the SAMOVA window
says the program has stopped responding.60 EvolDir January 1, 2011
I have installed the software across multiple machines,
at various points in a directory, and also from the C: \
root. Both the *.arp and *.geo ﬁles are in the software
directory.
I used my original software installation to run the demo
ﬁles some months ago and generated output. The
same input ﬁles now produce the same problem as my
dataﬁles. I thought this may mean that the software
has somehow been corrupted and re-downloaded the
software to start from scratch.......but the result is the
same.
If anyone has an hints I’d be very grateful to hear from
you.

Software DAMBE winclade function
Dear All,
My program DAMBE has a WinClade function in its
newest version. What it does is to display a topology
so that you can drag nodes to each other and DAMBE
will display, in a corner of the window, the tree length
(i.e., the minimum number of state changes along the
tree based on the MP criterion), the consistency index,
the retention index and the rescaled consistency index.
DAMBE is free from my web site.
If you have already used DAMBE and want to in-
stall the new version, please remove the old version
and check if the DllWithDialog.DLL ﬁle is still in the
C:\windows \system32 directory. If yes, remove it man-
ually before installing the new version.
Usage: start DAMBE, read in a sequence ﬁle, click
’Phylogenetics |WinClade’, drag nodes to each other,
and click the ’Evaluate’ button, followed by more drag-
ging and more clicking.

Software StacksJanuary 1, 2011 EvolDir 61
I am pleased to introduce the Stacks analysis pipeline.
Stacks is a software pipeline for building loci out of a set
of short-read sequenced samples. Stacks was developed
for the purpose of building genetic maps from Illumina
sequence data, but can also be readily applied to popu-
lation studies, SNP identiﬁcation for genotyping arrays,
and phylogeography.
http://creskolab.uoregon.edu/stacks/ Stacks special-
izes in tracking a set of alleles within a population.
These alleles are deﬁned by SNPs which are called using
a maximum likelihood framework.
Stacks is programmed in C++ (with helper programs
in Perl), is parallelized (and fast!), and can handle small
and large data sets into the hundreds of individuals.
The software pipeline uses a MySQL database backend
to provide a web-based user interface facilitating view-
ing of the data and supporting its annotation and man-
ual correction. The backend also supports the addition
of ESTs, paired-end minicontigs, or other sequence in-
formation that is associated with the generated markers
by programs such as BLAST or BLAT.
Stacks is free software, released under the GNU GPL
license. Lots more information can be found on the
website:
http://creskolab.uoregon.edu/stacks/ I am happy to
answer any questions you may have about the program:
jcatchen@uoregon.edu.

SouthAfrica VolunteerBirdEvolution
Volunteer Field Position in Bird Biology
We are seeking enthusiastic, motivated, and detail-
oriented ﬁeld assistants to help on a study on the neu-
roendocrine basis of cooperative breeding in the socia-
ble weaver (Philetairus socius) in the Northern Cape of
South Africa. Sociable weavers live in colonies ranging
from 2 to 500 individuals and their most notable feature
is the huge communal nest they construct. These are
the largest nests in trees found in nature. In this nestthere are separate chambers where familiar groups of
birds roost and breed. The broods can be attended by
individuals, besides the parents, that help in providing
care for the oﬀspring - cooperative breeding. Assistants
must be available from February 1st through April 1st,
2011(some ﬂexibility may be possible). The study site
is situated on a farm about 3 hours from Kimberley and
Upington, near Prieska. We will be living in the farm.
The assistants’ work will involve nest inspection, be-
havioral observations, help in carrying out ﬁeld experi-
ments, help with catching and processing of birds, and
data entry. We will work 5-6 days a week in the ﬁeld.
Comfort in the outdoors is essential, due to the remote
nature of the ﬁeld site and the extreme temperatures.
Qualiﬁcations: (1) Advanced undergraduate in biology,
ecology, veterinary science, or related ﬁeld. Bachelor’s
or master’s preferred.
(2) Previous ﬁeld research experience. Knowledge in
observing & handling birds preferable.(3) Ability to
work independently and in small teams with a good at-
titude. (4) Attention to detail and organization. Abil-
ity to carry out repetitive work with quality and con-
sistency.
(4) Valid driver’s license.
(5) Fluency in English. We will cover expenses as-
sociated with food, accommodation and travel within
South Africa. While, additional subsidy may be avail-
able, assistants will be responsible for travel costs to
Cape Town or Kimberley. Interested applicants should
send a CV, a 1-page maximum letter of interest and the
name of two references to: pclopes@berkeley.edu. I am
happy to provide potential candidates with more details
on the project. Deadline for applications is: January
10, 2011.

Speciation travel grants
Dear colleagues,
The European Research Networking Programme “Fron-
tiers of Speciation Research”, supported by 18 National
Funding Organizations in member countries of the Eu-
ropean Science Foundation, is inviting applications for
travel grants intended to foster collaborations between
European researchers working on topics related to the
Programme.62 EvolDir January 1, 2011
Support is available for short visits (up to 2 weeks)
and exchange grants (up to 3 months), with preference
given to junior researchers at a graduate or postdoc-
toral level. Applicants will want to keep in mind that,
owing to the diﬀerence in costs, applications for short
visits are more likely to be successful than applications
for exchange grants.
Applications are reviewed quarterly after a submis-
sion deadline of 24:00 CET on 15 March, 15 June, 15
September, and 15 December. About 4-6 weeks after
each deadline, the ESF will inform applicants about the
outcome of evaluations.

Judy Stone <jstone@colby.edu >Sumatran Bird mobbing behaviour
Hi all,
I am writing to seek some help with regard to a re-
search project I am doing with forest understory birds
in lowland Sumatra.
My study involves using playback to try to elicit the
“mobbing” response of understory birds, and I am look-
ing for an appropriate stimulus (aka playback ﬁle) to
serve that purpose. Unfortunately for lowland Suma-
tra, we don’t have such eﬀective and reliable tools as
the Collared Owlet call in higher elevations. Still, I am
wondering if there might be some way around to excite
birds here - hence this email here, trying to seek wider
help from birders in the region.
I have two main questions here:
1) Is there a decent stimulus for the lowland forest in
eliciting mobbing from small-bodied forest birds, that
can work similarly to the Collared Owlet call in the
montane areas? Two very experienced birders already
told me that the answer is probably no, but I just
wanted to see if other people might have a diﬀerent
answer, or could suggest some less eﬀective but still
workable stimuli.
2) If it isn’t possible to elicit mobbing using preda-
tor/owl calls in the lowland, is it possible to use the
alarm calls of some of the prey species instead? Here, I
am primarily thinking about some of the key informa-
tion givers in the community, such as babblers and/or
bulbuls. My experience in some other temperate places
with Paridae suggests that alarm calls from some of the
vocal parid species indeed are very strong stimuli for
eliciting the mobbing response from other small birds
- so I’m wondering if this would be similarly appliable
here. I would really appreciate it if fellow birders with
such experiences could share some info with me, and in
particular, if you happen to have ﬁles of the alarm calls
of these birds (or basically any species that share preda-
tors with these small-bodied birds), I would greatly ap-
preciate it if you could kindly share the call ﬁle with
me.
Thanks very much for your attention and assistance.

ColoradoState DiseaseModeling
The Webb Lab at Colorado State University was re-
cently funded to develop data-driven models of disease
spread in the US cattle population, most likely using a
contact network approach. The goal of the project is
to both predict spread during disease outbreaks for theJanuary 1, 2011 EvolDir 65
US and to test containment and mitigation strategies.
While these types of models have been successful for
understanding and managing disease outbreaks in other
countries, they have not previously been developed for
the US due to data limitations. We are developing a
new database that should allow us to overcome these
previous limitations. Qualiﬁed individuals interested in
working on this project should contact Colleen Webb

tionary ecology).
Our research addresses the following questions: How do
Arabidopsis thaliana from contrasting natural environ-
ments diﬀer functionally and structurally? What are
the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) and genes underly-
ing key traits involved in adaptation? How does the
substitution of adaptive QTL inﬂuence the phenotype,
gene expression/regulation and plant ﬁtness? Are there
adaptive tradeoﬀs between traits and/or pleiotropy be-
tween adaptive QTL?
Preference will be given to candidates with a strong
background in evolution and/or physiology, and train-
ing in one or more of the following areas: molecular bi-
ology, molecular genetics, genomics, evolutionary ecol-
ogy, and ecophysiology. Activities of the diﬀerent labs

Montpellier PopulationGenetics
Dear Evoldir members,
A postdoctoral fellowship in theoretical population
genetics will be available at the CBGP laboratory
(Centre de Biologie et de Gestion des Populations <
http://www1.montpellier.inra.fr/CBGP/ >, Montpel-
lier, France) to develop new methods for demographicinference under various demographic models. We are
especially interested in investigating inference of diver-
gence times, migration rates and past demographic ﬂuc-
tuations from genetic data. The applicant will develop
inferential methods that can jointly consider combina-
tion of genetic markers with diﬀerent mutation rates
and processes, such as combination of microsatellites,
mitochondrial and nuclear sequences as well as SNPs.
The successful applicant will focus on coalescent algo-
rithms for maximum likelihood inference, based on the
importance sampling developments of R. C. Griﬃths
and collaborators. The main phase of the project will
be to develop algorithms for sequence and SNP data
analyses into an existing software for coalescent-based
genetic data analyses (the Migraine software <http://-
kimura.univ-montp2.fr/%7Erousset/Migraine.html >).
Experience with C/C++ programming, theoretical
population genetics and/or mathematics/statistics on
stochastic processes, are highly desirable. Evolution-
ary biology knowledge is a plus but is not necessary.
The successful applicant will be based at the CBGP,
in Montpellier. Starting date will be in 2011 but is
quite ﬂexible. The CBGP laboratory is part of a very
large community of research on evolution and ecology in
Montpellier. The city of Montpellier is a vibrant stu-
dent town with beautiful surroundings. Gross salary
will be around 2 500 per month, depending on experi-
ence, plus social security, computing resources, research
expenses and travels.
Funding is already available for one year by the French
National Research Agency (ANR). If I have named ap-
plicants (but not French) before the end of the year
(2010), I am quite conﬁdent that renewal for one to
two years can be funded by the INRA (French National
Institute For Agronomical Research). Interested appli-
cant are thus asked to quickly email a CV with brief
statement of qualiﬁcations and interest in the project,
as well as contact information for two references to
Raphael LEBLOIS (raphael.leblois@supagro.inra.fr).
More details about the position:
The applicant will be involved in two already-funded
large projects.
First, the EMILE project (“Inference Methods
and Software for Evolutionary studies”, http://-
www1.montpellier.inra.fr/wikis/EMILE/index.php/-
Accueil ) aims to develop new population genetics
inference methods and involves numerous populations
geneticists and statisticians. For his research, the
applicant will primarily interact with R. Leblois
(CBGP), F. Rousset(University of Montpellier), J.-M.
Cornuet (CBGP), R. Vitalis (CBGP), J.M. Marin70 EvolDir January 1, 2011
(University of Montpellier), C. Robert (Dauphine
University, Paris).
Second, the IM-MODEL@CORAL.FISH project (“An
isolation-migration model of the history of coral reef
ﬁsh communities: theory and data”) is a collaboration
between a Raphael Leblois (INRA - CBGP, Montpel-
lier), Serge Planes (University of Perpignan, France),
Michel Veuille and Thierry Wirth (Museum National
dHistoire Naturelle, Paris, France), on paciﬁc coral reef
ﬁsh community history. Applications of the new meth-
ods will be principally done on the coral ﬁsh data but
will also be done on already published data sets. Reg-
ular meetings are organized by both projects, allowing
the applicant to interact with both the empirical and
theoretical sides of population genetics.

2 POSTDOC POSITIONS IN MONTPELLIER: THE-
ORETICAL EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY
2 two-year post-doctoral positions are available in
the Evolutionary Ecology and Epidemiology (EEE)
group based at the Centre d’ ´Ecologie Fonctionnelle et
´Evolutive (CEFE) in Montpellier, France. The start-
ing date of these positions is fairly ﬂexible, but must
be between January 2011 and December 2011.
The EEE group hosts two permanent researchers (Syl-
vain Gandon and S´ ebastien Lion), two post-doctoral
researchers (Thomas Berngruber and Pedro Vale), oneJanuary 1, 2011 EvolDir 71
PhD student (Fran¸ cois Blanquart) and one research as-
sistant (Fran¸ cois Gatchitch). We work on a combina-
tion of theoretical and experimental approaches.
Our current research interests include: (1) the evolu-
tion of bacteria-phage interactions, (2) the evolutionary
ecology of avian malaria, (3) the evolution of spatially
structured populations, and (4) the evolution of host-
parasite interactions under high mutation rates.
We are looking for theoretical biologists to analyze
the eﬀects of high mutation rates (postdoc 1 with
S. Gandon) and spatial structure (postdoc 2 with S.
Lion) on evolutionary dynamics, in particular (but
not only) in the context of host-parasite interac-
tions. Both S. Gandon and S. Lion would be in-
volved in the supervision of the two projects. In ad-
dition, Guillaume Martin ( http://www.isem.cnrs.fr/-
spip.php?article935&lang=3Den ) will be involved in
the co-supervision of the project on the eﬀects high mu-
tation rates.
We are particularly interested in the interface between
these two questions. We would also be happy to discuss
other biological questions and more personal research
programs, and how they could be tied to the ongoing
projects of the EEE group.
Applicants should have a PhD either in biology (partic-
ularly evolution or ecology), or in mathematics and/or
physics. In any case, the applicant must display a
strong motivation for biological and evolutionary ques-
tions. A track record in evolutionary ecology or epi-
demiology will be an advantage, and a strong back-
ground in mathematical modeling is required. An in-
terest in the dialogue between theory and experiments
will also be appreciated. Knowledge of the French lan-
guage is not required.
If you are interested in any of these positions, please
email a CV, a brief statement of research interests and
the contact information of two references to both S.
Gandon and S. Lion before March 1st 2011.

Postdoc Position in Behavioral, Chemical, and Evolu-
tionary Ecology
Date: Position available immediately (February 1,
2010)
Salary: Commensurate with training and experience
Term: 3 years
Position Description: This is an NSF-funded project.
The Post-Doctoral Researcher will work with C. Schal
(NCSU) and A. Groot (NCSU, Max Planck Institute
for Chemical Ecology [MPICE] in Jena, Germany, and
University of Amsterdam). In many moth species, male
pheromone is important for species-recognition and fe-
male acceptance of males. However, despite the recog-
nition that males invest disproportionately in the tis-
sues that produce these pheromones, their roles in ad-
vertising male quality and guiding female mate choice
have not been considered. This project addresses two
major questions: (a) How does natural variation in
close-range sexual signals aﬀect female choice in moth
species where the male pheromone resembles the female
pheromone? and (b) Is the production of male sexual
signals linked to production of female signals in these
species? Speciﬁcally, the postdoc, working in collab-
oration with a graduate student will: (1) chemically
identify the close-range male pheromones in two moth
species (fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda, and to-
bacco budworm Heliothis virescens), (2) quantify the
magnitude of between-strain intraspeciﬁc variation in
the male pheromones, and (3) evaluate what variable
features of the male pheromone contribute to female
choice.
Portions of this project will be conducted at the MPICE
and University of Amsterdam, providing a unique op-
portunity to be trained and conduct research in an in-
ternational collaborative setting.
Qualiﬁcations: Ph.D. trained in entomology, biology,
chemistry, behavior, evolutionary biology, or related
ﬁelds. Experience in chemical ecology, including ex-
traction, puriﬁcation, behavioral assays and identiﬁca-
tion of semiochemicals. Instrumentation skills, includ-
ing GC, MS, and electrophysiology (EAG, GC-EAD).72 EvolDir January 1, 2011
Application: Submit CV, relevant reprints and
manuscripts, and a letter describing background, skills
and interests. Also submit names, e-mail addresses and
phone numbers of three references to:

Applications will be considered until a suitable candi-
date is found and the position is ﬁlled.

InsectDiseaseEvolution
Modeling Insect/Disease Evolution
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: We are looking for a post-
doc to work on a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
research project aimed at assessing the potential util-
ity as well as risks associated with using selﬁsh genetic
elements to drive genes into mosquito populations that
render them incapable of transmitting dengue fever or
malaria.
The postdoc will be involved in building and testing
stochastic, spatially explicit, simulation models that
link insect population dynamics, population genetics
and human disease epidemiology in a way that can con-
tribute to improving strategies for releasing transgenic
mosquitoes to reduce the incidence of human disease.
One of our new eﬀorts will be in using parallel comput-
ing to increase the spatial scale of our models. We are
also building simple spatial and non-spatial, determin-
istic and stochastic models as heuristic tools for better
understanding basic principles, but we are not looking
for applicants who are only interested in working with
simple, generic models.
In addition to working on model development and anal-
ysis, the person in this position will collaborate in
an interdisciplinary Gates-funded group composed of
mosquito ecologists, disease epidemiologists, molecular
biologists, biomathematicians, ethicists, and scientists
from disease-endemic countries, in eﬀorts to developnovel transgenic strategies for disease reduction.
QUALIFICATIONS: Training in evolutionary biology
and experience with development of computer simula-
tion models.

Project: Protein Function and Network Analysis We
are using machine learning and computational mod-
elling techniques to infer protein function from pro-
tein sequence, evolution, or interactions. The goal is
to build a map of all proteins with details on how they
interact with each other and other molecules. A pro-
tein’s biochemical function and its context with inter-
action partners are key to understanding its biological
function. This map, or functional network, is developed
to discover pathways and modules, and to predict the
function of previously un(der)characterised proteins.
In this systems biology project, heterogeneous dataJanuary 1, 2011 EvolDir 75
sources are combined to predict functional coupling be-
tween proteins in order to build networks that model
pathways and interaction cascades. The data sources
include co-expression, co-evolution, co-regulation, co-
localisation, physical and genetic interactions, domain-
domain interactions, and various sequence-based prop-
erties. The used methods include Bayesian networks,
support vector machines, regression models, and in-
house developed models.
The project involves programming, data analysis,
benchmarking, and modelling, but also application
of the developed methods to genes of particular in-
terest, such as disease genes, in order to discover
new protein functions and pathways. See http://-
FunCoup.sbc.su.se/ andhttp://InParanoid.sbc.su.se/ .
The successful candidate should have a Ph.D. in bioin-
formatics or related ﬁeld, and detailed knowledge of
molecular biology. Alternatively, a Ph.D. in molecular
biology or related ﬁeld and at least 1 year of practi-
cal experience in bioinformatics research. Familiarity

ence announces: Postdoctoral position in Theoretical
Biology ˆ a (two)
The Centre for Theoretical Biology at the University of
Gothenburg (CTBio) hereby adver- tises two postdoc-
toral position (junior researchers).
Several research groups in Gothenburg address ba-
sic evolutionary questions, empirically and mathemati-
cally. We have formed a centre for theoretical biology,
established by the Faculty of Natural Sciences (Uni-
versity of Gothenburg) in November 2006. The cen-
tre brings empiri- cal biologists, mathematicians, and
theoretical physicists together. Its goal is to stimulate
in- terdisciplinary collaboration and scientiﬁc quality in
theoretical biology. The research groups are located atJanuary 1, 2011 EvolDir 79
diﬀerent departments.
Duties The appointees are supposed to conduct their
own research independently and also to partici- pate
in the planning and execution of projects coordinated
at CTBio. One project (A) deals with implementa-
tion of the multispecies coalescent for genomes resid-
ing in polyploid orga- nisms. The aim of the other
project, (B), is to develop coalescent models describ-
ing the meta- population dynamics of a marine inver-
tebrate species, Littorina saxatilis. This species is a
widely used model for evolutionary studies and com-
prehensive background data is available (evolutionary
ecology, behaviour, population genetics and intraspe-
ciﬁc phylogeny). The projects involve intense collabo-
rations not only with theoreticians but also with evolu-
tionary biologists.
Start date and hosting department is by agreement with
the appointee.
Qualiﬁcations Completed doctorate in Mathematics,
Mathematical Statistics, Physics, Computer Science, or
Biology, and documented in-depth knowledge of phy-
logenetics, branching processes and coalescent theory,

Postdoctoral Research Associate, Microbial Ecology
and Evolution
Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, UK
We seek an enthusiastic and highly motivated evolu-
tionary biologist/ microbial ecologist to study compet-
itive interactions between bacteria and burying beetles
for access to carrion. We have previously shown that
microbial decomposers of carrion cause signiﬁcant harm
to beetle larvae. Furthermore, we have shown that bee-
tles can reduce this harm by providing various forms
of parental care for the larvae. The speciﬁc aims of
this project are to: 1) Determine the ﬁtness eﬀects of
microbes on beetles when competing for access to car-
rion. 2) Identify the bacterial species that decompose
carrion using 454 deep- sequencing, the nature of the
anti-competitor compounds these species secrete, and
against whom these toxic products are targeted. 3)
Determine the eﬀects of behavioural, physiological and
biochemical counterstrategies used by beetles and bee-
tle larvae to contend with microbial competitors. The
ideal applicant will have interest and experience in mi-
crobiology and evolutionary biology.
The successful applicant will be responsible for design-
ing and carrying out experiments, analyzing experimen-
tal results, preparing manuscripts, and helping with the
supervision of students. You should hold a PhD in a
relevant biological discipline and have a strong back-
ground in evolutionary biology. Experience in microbial
ecology is desirable.
This work is a collaborative project between Daniel
Rozen and Andrew McBain at the University of Manch-
ester and Per Smiseth at the University of Edinburgh.
Occasional travel to Edinburgh will be required.
Funded by the Leverhulme Trust, this position is ten-
able from 15 January 2011 for 19 months.

Post-doctoral opportunity: Tracing population linkages
of stream gobies in Hawaii using microchemistry UW-
Madison Center for Limnology, University of Wisconsin
The McIntyre lab group in the Center for Limnology
at the University of Wisconsin seeks a post-doc to use
the microchemistry of ﬁsh otoliths to infer individual
movement histories and population connectivity. The
work is part of a larger team project to quantify link-
ages among populations of at-risk stream gobies across
the Hawaiian archipelago by merging population ge-
netic, ﬁeld assessment, and environmental chemistry
approaches. PIs include Mike Blum (Tulane), Jim
Gilliam (NC State), and McIntyre. Otolith work is con-
ducted in close collaboration with Nate Bickford (U of
Great Falls).
The post-doc will lead the collection, preparation, and
chemical analysis of otoliths as well as subsequent sta-
tistical analysis and manuscript preparation. This will
include samples from conspeciﬁc gobies collected from
dozens of watersheds across ﬁve islands, yielding un-
usually rich biogeochemical datasets. Two types of
chemical analyses are of interest: trace element pro-
ﬁles (pilot work included 18 isotopes of 13 elements) by
LA-ICP-MS to characterize the chemical environment
during natal, larval, and post-settlement periods; and
O isotope ratios by ion microprobe to reconstruct ther-
mal histories during larval and post-settlement periods.
Results will be interpreted in evolutionary, population,
landscape, and conservation contexts.
The expected task list has ﬁve components: joining the
ﬁeld team for roughly three months of intensive sam-
pling throughout the Hawaiian archipelago in spring
2011; preparation and analysis of otoliths; statistical
analysis of the 2011 dataset as well as an extensive pilot
dataset; preparation of multiple manuscripts on otolith
results; and contribution to team manuscripts synthe-
sizing overall results of the project. Additional oppor-
tunities for involvement in other otolith-based projects
in my lab group also may be available.
Experience in both ﬁeld work and environmental chem-
istry, a successful publication record, and a posi-
tive, team-oriented attitude are essential qualiﬁcations.
Candidates with speciﬁc experience in the preparationand elemental/isotopic analysis of ﬁsh otoliths (or other
carbonates) are particular encouraged to apply. The
successful applicant must be able to work independently
on otolith analyses, but also contribute to the esprit de
corps of my lab group and the broader project team.
Please see my website for more project details and
lab philosophy: http://limnology.wisc.edu/personnel/-
mcintyre/ The position will begin on or around 1
February 2011, and funding is available through at least
May 2012 (pending performance). A competitive post-
doc salary will be oﬀered, including UW-Madison ben-
eﬁts package. Aside from ﬁeld work, the position will
be based at the Center for Limnology of the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin in Madison. The Center’ is home to
a world-renowned aquatic sciences research group, and
features a vibrant atmosphere in which collegial inter-
actions among faculty, staﬀ, post-docs, and graduate
students are the norm. Madison is widely recognized
for its high quality of life, lively culture and arts scene,
and easy access to natural areas. Costs of living are
moderate, and public buses or bicycle paths are easy
transportation options.
To apply, please submit a letter of interest, CV,
three relevant reprints (in pdf form), and phone &
email addresses of three references to Denise Karns

plicitly address relevant experience/expertise in both
ﬁeld and lab settings. Review of applications will be-
gin Dec 26 and will continue until the position is ﬁlled.

but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
