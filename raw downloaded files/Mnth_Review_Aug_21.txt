MidwestPopGenetics Aug20-21
Dear colleagues,
I am excited to announce tentative plans for an in-person
edition of the Midwest Population Genetics Meeting,
planned for August 20 and 21 in Madison, Wisconsin
(USA). Whereas large conferences have understandably
been postponed this year, I believe that our smaller
conference can be conducted safely at this stage of the
pandemic, and we can be nimble in changing plans if
needed.
This will be the 7th incarnation of this regional meeting,
which has occurred annually since 2014 with the excep-
tion of last year. The meeting will include talks (mostly
from graduate students and postdocs), posters, and op-
portunities for informal interaction. The meeting is typ-
ically held from roughly 1pm on a Friday through 5pm
on a Saturday, but this year's exact schedule remains to
be determined. Conference policies and planning will
prioritize a range of COVID-19 safety measures, includ-
ing mask-wearing, social distancing, outdoor-ventilated
conference space, and outdoor food breaks. We also
expect that all participants would be vaccinated by the
time of the meeting.
The purposes of this message are to: (1) Serve as a \Save
the Date" notice as you consider your summer plans,
and (2) Invite you to sign up to receive updates, such
as announcing when conference application opens. Thisis important because I anticipate that demand for this
meeting may be greater than usual, in light of the lack
of in-person conferences during 2020 and 2021. And yet,
space and social distancing will necessitate a limited
number of attendees at this meeting. Therefore, it is
likely that we will need to implement an application
system, and to prioritize attendance based on career
stage, diversity and focus of research topics, and COVID
safety.
If you think you may be interested in attending this
meeting, then I strongly encourage you to sign up for the
following e-mail group, so that you will have opportu-
nity to apply while space remains. You must either: (A)

MidwestPopGenetics Deadline
June15
Dear colleagues,
The outlook for an in-person Midwest Population Genet-
ics Meeting (MWPG) in Madison this August continues
to look favorable. However, because we anticipate both
elevated demand for this meeting and ongoing limits on
the density of indoor gatherings, we are implementing
an application system for this meeting. Applications
are now being accepted through June 15 via the link at
the bottom of this message.
MWPG 2021 is scheduled to take place at the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin - Madison on Friday/Saturday August
20/21, with exact schedule including start and end times
of the meeting to be announced. We have reserved the
\Lake Mendota Room" at Dejope Hall for this event. The
large size (4700 sq ft) and outdoor ventilation of this
space will contribute to our safety precautions. There
will also be a mask requirement, food breaks will be held
outdoors, and we expect that all participants will have
been vaccinated against COVID-19 before this event.
A consistent priority for MWPG has been to oer grad
students and postdocs a venue to present their research.
There will be a limited number of talk slots available
in our schedule (it may not be possible to grant all
talk requests). There will also be dedicated time in
the schedule for posters. There should also be a Friday
evening barbecue or similar interactive event.
There is no registration fee for this event. Some food is
likely to be provided. Attendees will be responsible for
their own transportation and lodging costs. A block of
rooms has been reserved at the on-campus Union Hotel.
In spite of the likely limits on our conference attendance,
we really do encourage everyone who is interested to
apply (who knows - we may yet have room for everyone).
Applications are due by June 15th (end of day), and
we will aim to conrm our invited list of meeting atten-
dees by July 2nd. No deadline reminder messages are
anticipated, so please apply based on this notice. Appli-
cation (which includes abstract submission if presenting)
consists of the following online form: https://forms.gle/-

Dear EvolDir members,
We are pleased to announce the coming talk at the
online CIGENE seminar.
Date: 19.05.2021
Presenter: Mark Ravinet
Title: The evolution of human commensalism in Passer
sparrows.
Abstract: From early civilization to the development of
modern cities, human activity has shaped the evolution
of other species. Some taxa are able to survive, adapt
and even thrive in an anthropogenic niche. Human
commensal species are a special case, having evolved
a dependency on human resources without our direct
inuence. Intriguingly, human commensal relationships
have arisen multiple times across many dierent species
and even in parallel within the same genus. What fac-
tors drive the evolution of human commensalism? Is it
a case of being in the right place at the right time? Or
are there particular (pre)adaptations, traits and genes
that mean some species are better able to exploit human
resources than others? To explore these questions, I will4 EvolDir August 1, 2021
focus on the repeated evolution of human commensalism
in a single genus - Passer sparrows. I will show that we
are able to use genomic data to reconstruct when and
where human commensalism arose in each species. In
particular,
I will demonstrate that major human cultural transi-
tions, i.e. the development of agriculture, have led to
range expansions in these widespread and well-known
birds. Finally, I will show that by combining phenotypic
and genomic data, we are able to investigate the genetic
basis for key traits involved in adapting to a human
commensal life history.

BiomarkersEvolOfSenescence Jul6-7
Abstract submission and registration deadline extended
until Friday June 4th
Abstract submissions are invited for 10 min talks and
posters at the online ESEB 2021 satellite symposium:
How have biomarkers improved our understanding of
the evolution of senescence?
6-7 July 2021: talks, 12:30-16:30 CEST; posters, evening
of 6th July
As individuals reach older ages their bodies deteriorate
- a process known as senescence. Individuals within the
same species can dier greatly in the age they start to
senesce, and the rate at which they senesce. However,
why individuals senesce so dierently remains unresolved
and is one of the biggest unanswered questions in evolu-
tionary biology. Understanding the drivers of senescence
has important ramications for veterinary medicine, con-
servation, health and society, as it could help individuals
to live longer, healthier lives. This symposium will seek
to address this knowledge gap by bringing together re-
searchers with expertise in senescence from theoretical,
laboratory and eld settings. In particular it will focuson how our understanding of health and the evolution
of senescence has been altered with the development of
indicators and biomarkers of senescence such as epige-
netic clocks and telomeres. These biomarkers have shed
light on the relative impact of social, environmental,
genetic and trans-generational eects on senescence. A
synthesis of advances in the evolutionary theory of senes-
cence, the occurrence and life-history consequences of
senescence, and the underlying genetic and non-genetic
mechanisms driving variation in individual senescence
will signicantly further the eld. This knowledge is
vital to understanding why senescence has evolved and
how variance is maintained.

remarkable-diversity-in-the-rate-and-mechanisms-of-
sex-chromosome-evolution Sex chromosomes are
assumed to evolve from a pair of homologous autosomes,
where the emergence of a sex-determining locus and
recombination suppression triggered gradual structural
changes such as accumulation of sexual antagonistic
alleles, recombination arrest, accumulation of repeats,
loss of functional genes and heterochromatinization.
This model represents the classical paradigm for
decades, implying a roughly linear process of sex
chromosome degeneration from homomorphism to
heteromorphism. Recently, comparative genomics have
revealed an incredible diversity on the morphology,
structure, age and stage of sex chromosomes in
non-model species, questioning the role of previously
assumed evolutionary drivers and other aspects of
sex chromosome dierentiation. It remains unclear
why lineages dier so substantially in the degree
of dierentiation and the long-term stability of sex
chromosomes. The current advances on genetic and
genomic methodologies allows us to explore long lasting
enigmas on the evolution of sex chromosomes across
the tree of life, such as the role of sexual antagonism,
chromosomal rearrangement, mechanisms of dosage
compensation and dierentiation rates. Therefore, in
the current meeting, we welcome all studies exploring
the evolution of sex chromosomes and sex determination
with either theoretical or empirical approaches. The list
of invited speakers is available below. In parallel to the
online meeting, we invite all attendants to participate
in the homonymous special issue on the Journal of
Evolutionary Biology, with a review manuscript or
original investigation. The submission deadline for the
special issue is 31 December 2021.

Online GenomeEvolution May19-21
Dear EvolDir,
Join us for the virtual symposium on \Models of Genome
Evolution from Populations to Species" hosted by the
Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study during the 19th
- 21st of May 2021, http://www.swedishcollegium.se/-
Symposium5/Symp Home.html 19 - 21 May, 2021
Studies of genome evolution are generally based on twoapproaches, phylogenetic methodology that relies on
inter-species variation, and population genetics method-
ology that relies on intra-species variation. The two
approaches, thus, focus on two dierent time-scales, and
dierent models and methods have emerged in both
disciplines. Dierent model assumptions have led to
a separation of the two disciplines, and informa- tion
content extracted by each of the two approaches is rarely
combined. However, motivated by the recent increase in
genome sequence data, eorts in method development
have been made to counteract the distinc- tion between
phylogenetic and population genetics methodology.
The idea of this symposium is to discuss and compare
dierent approaches that cross the bridge between inter-
and intra-specic studies. The discussions shall improve
our understanding of the information content provided
in genome sequence data across time-scales and stimu-
late further method development to eciently use the
increasing amount of data available.

Dear All,
De deadline for submitting abstracts for the 17th edition
of the Symposium on Insect Plant relationships is ap-
proaching quickly (31 May 2021). We still have room for
oral contributions. The online symposium deals with all
relevant topics on Insect Plant Interaction ranging from
Ecology, Evolution, Genomics, Metabolomics, weed con-
trol with insects to plant pollinator interactions. Each
topic is introduced by a world leading expert in the eld.
On the website, you will nd a preliminary schedule
indicating time (Central European summertime (UTC
+2)) and themes. Note that we restricted the number
of presentations on a day and included several breaks
to optimize the potential to interact with peers. For

Conference location & dates: Virtually, world-wide. The
conference will run continuously from 12 July 0700 UTC
to 14 July 0700 UTC, in order to cover all timezones
(with Europe/Africa and the Americas spanning July
12-13, and Asia/Pacic spanning July 13-14).
Registration price: FREE (registration will open soon,keep an eye out for an email announcement)
Plenary speakers:
Michael Eisen - University of California, Berkeley. Title:
TBA
Hannah Fraser - University of Melbourne. Title: \Meta-
research from ecological and interdisciplinary perspec-
tives"
Michael Jennions - Australian National University. Title:
\A Drunkard's Walk: from negative results to reverse

We want to facilitate lively exchanges of ideas, and so
the following three event types will be the heart of the
conference:
Unconferences: Facilitated discussions of ideas for how
to make ecology, evolutionary biology, and related disci-
plines more open, reliable, and transparent. Facilitation
involves moderating the conversation with ideas and
examples, but there are no formal presentations.
Hackathons: Group projects with well-dened goals
(papers, techniques, software, protocols, organizations,
etc.).
Workshops: Facilitators will teach tools for implement-
ing open, reliable, and transparent practices.
We strongly encourage you to propose one of the above
types of Facilitated Sessions at www.sortee.org/events
. We also invite you to propose a Short Presentation
to share your experience with issues of openness, relia-
bility, and transparency in scientic research that are
relevant to people working in elds related to ecology
and evolutionary biology. For example, you could reect
on failures in your own work and what they taught you,
present tools or methods that can help others make their
research more open, reliable, and transparent, present
plans for an upcoming project, or present research that
integrates open science practices in an inspiring way.
We strongly encourage proposals for all contribution
types from people at a wide range of career stages and
from members of underrepresented groups.10 EvolDir August 1, 2021
For facilitated sessions (Workshops, Unconferences, and
Hackathons), we welcome proposals from small teams
(as well as individuals). We encourage teams to include
diverse perspectives, for instance with facilitators from
dierent countries and balanced in terms of gender and
career stage. Facilitation by early career researchers
(students or early career postdocs) is warmly encour-
aged.
We encourage people with any questions about accessi-
bility in the submission process or the events themselves
to contact us via sorteeconf2021@gmail.com. Similarly,
please feel free to contact us if you would like guidance
as you prepare your proposals and submissions.

EstonianU AdaptationFish
PhD position on multifaceted mechanisms of humic
adaptation in sh. Genotype and environment inter-
actions in Eurasian perch: analysis of morphological,
physiological and behavioural traits.
We are looking for an enthusiastic PhD student for
studying morphological, physiological and behavioural
mechanisms of adaptation to dark and acidic environ-
ment in Eurasian perch. The successful PhD candidate
will be part of an active international team working
with ecology, genomics and molecular ecology of aquatic
organisms at the Estonian University of Life Sciences.
Understanding the process of adaptation is one of the
most active elds of research in evolutionary biology
but despite enormous interest and a growing number
of analysis tools, it is still a daunting task to obtain
a comprehensive picture of the mechanisms of local
adaptation at dierent levels of biological complexity.
Humic lakes typically exhibit low pH (3.5-4.5), reduced
oxygen (O2) concentrations, strong O2 and tempera-
ture stratication, reduced light penetration and a shift
towards longer wavelengths. One of the very few sh
species that is able to thrive in both dark and clear
water habitats is Eurasian perch (Perca uviatilis). It
is therefore expected that perch populations inhabiting
humic lakes would have evolved specic adaptations at
multiple levels of biological organization that allow to
succeed in poor light, low pH and oxygen saturation con-
ditions. The proposed research represents a concerted
eort to advance our knowledge about genetic and en-
vironmental components responsible for adaptation to
humic environment by combining experimental cross-
ing, common garden experiments and eld studies with
analysis of wide range of morphological, physiological
and behavioural traits.
More specically, the PhD project aims at: 1. Charac-
terizing the genotype-environment interactions in mor-
phological, physiological and behavioural traits (incl.
the distribution, type and number of neuromasts, eye
size, pigmentation, transcript abundances, boldness and
feeding eciency). 2. Characterizing the genotype-
environment interactions of egg survival and sperm prop-
erties in relation to low pH, humic substances and ion
pump blockers. 3. Characterizing the genetic architec-
ture and functional consequences of variation in lateral
line morphology.
Qualications required: To be eligible for a PhD-student
position the applicant must hold a master's degree (orequivalent) in Evolutionary Biology, Ecology, Physiol-
ogy, Population Genetics, Bioinformatics or a related
eld. Candidates must be able to express themselves in

Qualications desired: We are looking for a highly moti-
vated candidate with experience in evolutionary biology,
ecology, physiology, genomics, or other closely related
elds of research. It is desirable that candidates are
familiar with one or more programming languages (such
as Python, Perl, or R) and statistics.

SeascapeGenomics
Investigating the role of oceanic circulation in plankton
communities structure and functioning
Director of Studies: Daniele Iudicone
Department of Integrative Marine Biology
Seat: Naples, Italy
Project Summary
An enduring challenge in ecology is to comprehend how
marine phytoplankton has developed and maintains
its large diversity, characterised by a complex web of
interactions, while living in a largely unstructured en-
vironment. As local assemblies are controlled by ocean
circulation and resource delivery, understanding the
relation between the species distribution and oceano-
graphic patterns becomes crucial. A fundamental step
to understand and predict the status and functioning of
pelagic ecosystems is to abandon the terrestrial concept
of landscape and, instead, consider the highly dynamic
seascape, i.e., to fully contemplate that the substrate
is a uid, where resources and organisms are moved
around by currents. Processes in the seascape cannot
be easily disentangled and many knowledge gaps still
exist about the role of its key components. We are also
missing an understanding of connectivity to be opera-
tionally used for sustainable ES management and policy
development. Finally, climate change is impacting the
seascapes in many, often subtle ways, with impacts on
biodiversity and on its services. Specically, the under-
standing of the oceanic biogeography remains limited;
e.g., the level of endemicity of planktonic species, a key
question in ecology, remains unconstrained. This has
important implications for the response to changes that
depends on acclimation capacities but also on the de-
gree of isolation and evolvability of the species, in turn
related to the ecosystem connectivity. Here we will thus
bring together complex systems, genomics and oceanog-
raphy to explore how the physical connectivity between
oceanic regions determines the local community struc-
tures (i.e., the coexistence of many species), supports
stable biogeographies and stretches species distributions
beyond their optimal conditions, thus impacting on the
ecosystem stability. The project plan will exploit the
genomic revolution in ecology, due to the direct access togenomic information on real ecosystems. The planned
activities will combine the analysis of the recent data
on the oceanic metagenomic functional diversity with
a hierarchy of conceptual models describing circulation
and plankton dynamics with increased complexity. As
main intellectual merit, our interdisciplinary team will
promote an innovative approach to the understanding of
the system via the validation of long standing hypothe-
ses. In addition, the study of the impact of dispersal
will allow to bridge terrestrial and marine ecology, with
broad impact on marine ecology and, especially, on cli-
mate change ecology. Finally, the identication of the
degree of locality of species and their equilibrium with
oceanic dispersal will create new avenues for theoretical
and applied research.

highly motivated and excellent doctoral student with
an interest in evolutionary physiology / transcriptomics.
The PhD project centres on the adaptation of Arctic
Daphnia to environmental change with a strong focus on
experimental work, including physiological assays and
life history experiments. Daphnia will be hatched from
lake sediment of the past 200 years, a time frame during
which warming and related environmental uctuation
have been particularly rapid and severe in the Arctic.
Applying the powerful experimental approach of \resur-
rection ecology", clonal lineages hatched from eggs of
several time periods will be established in the laboratory
to represent historic and modern Daphnia populations.
Clonal lineages of dierent age will be experimentally
exposed to environments reecting historic and modern
conditions in a controlled reciprocal transplant design.
By integrating phenotype and gene expression data, this
study will test to what extent phenotypic responses are
reected in the functional genome. The successful candi-
date will join an interdisciplinary team to integrate the
elds of paleolimnology, genomics, transcriptomics and
ecophysiology, with partners in the UK and Germany.

We are seeking a motivated PhD student for the project:
Biological Clocks in the Wild: the eects of articial
light at night on circadian rhythms of a migratory bird
at the Institute of Environmental Sciences, Jagiellonian
University (Poland)
What do we study: It is well established that biolog-
ical rhythms are fundamental drivers of biochemistry,
cell biology, physiology and behaviour. The regularity
of behaviours is governed by endogenous clocks, which
are adjusted and synchronised with environmental cues,
primarily light. Rapidly expanding anthropopressure
largely disrupts these cues. Yet, it is surprising how little
we know about the eects of disorders in the function-
ing of the internal time-keepers in free-ranging animals.
This project will aim at understanding the eects of
disturbance in environmental cues, i.e. light exposure,
on circadian clock of a wild migratory bird: collared
ycatcher (Ficedula albicollis). We will employ an ex-
perimental setup introducing articial light at night in
nestboxes during breeding season, at dierent stages
of development and quantify its eects on circadian
clock, physiology and behaviour. As a result we will
try to build a comprehensive understanding of shifts in
circadian rhythms and their consequences in a natural
population.
Job description: The PhD candidate will actively par-
ticipate in eldwork, collecting phenotypic, biological
and environmental data, sample preparation and lab
work. S/he will be interacting with the PI and other
team members, collaborators in Poland and worldwide,
and attend relevant workshops and conferences. It is
expected that the candidate will learn a large ecological
skill set that will allow him/her to infer the evolutionary
ecology of disturbed photoperiods in wild ycatchers.
Specically, the tasks will involve:
* active participation in eldwork across three breeding
seasons (ca. 2-3 months each year) on the Swedish island
of Gotland, * assessing the inuence of articial light
at night on immune response of birds, * planning and
performing PHA immune assays in the eld, * analysing16 EvolDir August 1, 2021
gene expression of specic immune genes, * conducting
statistical analyses, * presenting the work at local and
international conferences and preparing publications in
close collaboration with an international team.
Salary: A National Science Centre stipend is available
for 36 months (3000 PLN, a tax-free addition to a doc-
toral stipend provided by the Doctoral School for the
period of 48 months).
Requirements: 1) Formal conditions:
* MSc degree in a relevant eld of life sciences: biology,
ecology, molecular biology or similar achieved by the
time of enrolment;
* admission to the PhD program in Biology at
the Doctoral School of Exact and Natural Sciences

SexChromosomeEvolution
PhD student position on Neo-sex chromosome Evolution
in Grasshoppers
The Institute of Ecology and Evolution at the Faculty of
Biological Sciences, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena,
oers a PhD student position, starting 01/09/2021 (with
exibility).
Background In species with heteromorphic sex chromo-
somes, the sex-limited chromosome (e.g. the Y in XY
systems) has undergone recombination suppression, het-
erochromatinization, degeneration and gene loss, which
means that the expression levels of X-linked genes in
males will be half that of females. The solution is that
the X chromosome would be selected for dosage com-
pensation, a process countering the decay and silencing
of genes on the Y chromosomes. However, it is unclear
why some sex chromosomes have undergone complete
dosage compensation while other have not.
Project The project seeks to understand the evolu-
tion of dosage compensation using the grasshopper
Vandiemenella viatica species complex as a model sys-
tem. Multiple chromosomal fusions between the ances-
tral X and autosomes (neo-X) in dierent races/species
allow independent comparisons to investigate the tim-
ing and patterns of dosage compensation. The project
will utilize independent chromosomal-level assemblies,
DNA- and RNA-seq data and cytogenetics to explore the
mechanisms underlying the maintenance of gene dosage
across X0 and neo-XY sex chromosomes. Thereby the
project will explicitly test several key hypotheses for
evolution of dosage compensation and shed light on tem-
poral sequence of molecular evolution by the formation
of neo-sex chromosomes.
Roesearch environment The project is conducted in col-
laboration with Prof. Dr. Holger Schielzeth (involved
in structured doctoral programs) oering a multitude of
collaborative opportunities that give a perfect setting
for the project. Jena oers a lively and collaborative
research environment with a large faculty of Biological
Sciences and several research institutes devoted to the
life sciences.
Candidate requirements and work duties We are looking
for a candidate with a Master?s degree in evolution-
ary biology, bioinformatics, genetics, or other relevant18 EvolDir August 1, 2021
discipline and documented skills in computational anal-
yses. Prociency in written and spoken English is es-
sential, experience with DNA and RNA extractions is
benecial and willingness to work hands-on with lab
stocks of grasshoppers is required. Experience with
scientic writing will be a plus. Working duties will
include chromosome-level assemblies using short- and
long-sequencing reads and Hi-C data, genome anno-
tation, transcriptome assemblies and gene expression
analysis. The work duties can also include teaching and
other departmental duties (no more than 20%).

*Ecology and evolution of social impact and responsive-
ness in a wild sparrow population*
Two PhD-positions in Behavioral Ecology at LMU Mu-
nich. Application deadline: 15.06.2021
**
*Project description*
Social interactions characterize all wild populations and
aect evolution whenever heritable traits are plastic in
response to heritable traits of conspecics. The evolu-
tion of \social responsiveness" to and \social impact"
on other's phenotypes has attracted theoretical atten-
tion, but progress requires addressing key outstanding
questions: Do wild populations contain individual vari-
ation in degrees of social impact and responsiveness?
Does selection act on this variation, and which processes
maintain it? These key challenges will be addressed in a
research programme to understand social evolution. The
overarching aim is to combine the strengths of cutting-
edge behavioural ecology and quantitative genetics the-
ory to uniquely study the interplay between social inter-
actions and social selection in the wild. We will focus
on social foraging strategies in house sparrows on Nor-
wegian islands that use either private information and
actively nd food (\producers") or social information
to exploit food patches found by others (\scroungers").
Game theory predicts socially responsive shifts towardsAugust 1, 2021 EvolDir 19
scrounging when others produce, and /vice versa/. Us-
ing innovative high-throughput behavioural screening of
entire populations, we aim to assay >600 birds for their
producer-scrounger social impact and responsiveness
in>4,000 assays and determine genomic relatedness,
survival, and reproductive tness for all individuals. We
will address the following key objectives:
*PhD-project 1*will establish whether individuals are
repeatable in (i) average level of producing-scrounging
(\personality"), (ii) level of adjustment in producing-
scrounging to phenotypes expressed by partners (\social
responsiveness") and (iii) producing-scrounging elicited
in partners (\social impact"). We will quantify covari-
ances between these traits', describe (social) environmen-
tal sources of variation within and among individuals,
and test for covariances with various key behavioural (ag-
gression, exploratory tendency) and morphology traits
(body size and shape) predicted by adaptive theory.
*PhD-project 2 *will quantify how natural selection
acts on producing-scrounging reaction norms and study
whether selection pressures covary with key socioeco-
logical conditions; and thus determine the pathways
(components of tness) by which selection acts on this
variation in the social phenotype in this well-studied
system. This will make it possible to start exploring
the potential evolutionary consequences of selection on
social impact and responsiveness in the wild, thereby
providing crucial new insights into the evolution of social
behaviour and the role of social interactions in ecological
and evolutionary processes.
*Research and Project group*
The PhD-students will be embedded in the Behavioural
Ecology Group of the Ludwig Maximilian's University
of Munich, located in Martinsried. The group works
broadly on two topics: individual behaviour and life-
history (Prof. NJ Dingemanse) and pre- and post-
copulatory sexual selection (Dr. C Tuni). Our group
consists of ve PhD-students and two postdocs, oer-
ing a dynamic social environment. The PhD-projects
are part of a collaboration with the Centre for Bio-
diversity Dynamics at NTNU (Trondheim). Interna-
tional collaborators: Profs. B-E Saether, H Jensen, T-H
Ringsby, J Wright (NTNU), Prof. A. Wilson (Exeter)
and Prof. J. Morrand-Ferron (Ottowa). PhD-students
have the opportunity to apply for admission to the In-
ternational Research School for Organismal Biology of
the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology, which oers
high-quality teaching programs for PhD-students and
ample opportunity for networking and collaboration.
*Requirements *
The two successful candidates should have backgroundtraining in evolutionary biology and behavioural ecol-
ogy. We are looking for candidates that have experience
with eldwork, bird handling, and are able to work inde-
pendently. Coding skills are required for programming
electronics equipment (sophisticated PIT-tag readers)
and performing complex statistical analyses (e.g. multi-
variate animal models to estimate IGEs). Social skills
and ability to ourish in a team are important for winter
eldwork in Norway and various collaborative aspects.
Successful candidates speak uent English. Successful
candidates also speak uent Norwegian, Swedish or Dan-
ish to enable eective communication with farmers and
landowners onsite.
*Project duration and starting date*
Successful candidates will be oered a three-year PhD-
position funded by a grant of the German Science
Foundation to Prof. NJ Dingemanse. Starting date
is 01.09.2021.

Interested students are encouraged to get

F. Mugal, carina.mugal@ebc.uu.se.
Context:
The BATantiVIr project aims at studying the evolu-
tionary history of adaptation of immune genes in bats
(Chiroptera).
Bats are one of the most diverse and widespread mam-
malian order. They host many viruses, including
high-prole zoonoses (rabies, Nipah, Ebola & Marburg
loviruses, SARS coronavirus) and viruses close to pri-
mate pathogens (poxvirus, Hepatitis B Virus). During
bat evolution, lineage-specic adaptation may have oc-
curred as a response to pathogen selective pressure, dif-
ferentially shaping the innate immune repertoire in bat
species. However, most of the evolutionary history and
mechanism of bat antiviral immunity is still unknown.
The estimation of selection on genes frequently relies on
phylogenetic methods. However, since immune genes in
bats are highly polymorphic, it is crucial to incorporate
polymorphism in those phylogenetic analyses.
The study of polymorphism lies at the core of popu-
lation genetics theory, which focuses at the time-scale
of a single species and does not explicitly extend to
the inter-species scale. On the other hand, in classical
phylogenetic analysis, the presence of polymorphism is
ignored, and substitutions are assumed to occur instan-
taneously. The latter assumption biases the inference
of natural selection. Typically, polymorphic sites are
considered as substitutions, which results in an overesti-
mation of the presence of positive selection.
Project:
The aim of the PhD project is to ll the gap between
classical phylogenetics and population genetics, and pro-
vide a multi-scale approach for the estimation of natural
selection that incorporates intra- and inter-specic data.
This work will be based on the theoretical work of Carina
F. Mugal, which provides analytical solutions for the
inuence of polymorphism dynamics on the estimation
of selection in classical phylogenetic approaches. The
novel approach will implement the theory in order to
compute the transition probabilities between polymor-
phic states and substitutions among species. For this
purpose, the work also relies on models of speciation dy-
namics (starting with the simplest models of speciation,
so-called isolation-without-migration models).
The novel approach will be implemented in Bio++ li-
braries, which are a set of C++ libraries dedicated to
bioinformatics, phylogenetics, and molecular evolution.Finally, building on these developments, the student
will investigate the evolutionary dynamics of bat genes
that lie at the core of the BATantiVIr project.
Requirements:
The ideal candidate has a good knowledge of molecular
evolution, and a solid bases in mathematical modelling.
She/he is familiar with bioinformatics, population ge-
netics and phylogenetic concepts. Last, she/he is au-
tonomous in C++ programming.

Background: Growth variation under environmental in-

of the underlying molecular mechanisms remains limited.
This process, known as developmental phenotypic plas-
ticity, provides an invaluable opportunity to understand
the genotype-phenotype relationship and the impact of
the environment on this relationship.
Hypothesis: Variation in nutritional input causes ex-
treme growth variation through changes in DNA methy-
lation states and transcriptional regulation. This hy-August 1, 2021 EvolDir 21
pothesis is supported by preliminary data.
Model system: We test this hypothesis in the water
strider Microvelia longipes (Image). The males have
longer legs than females, but also extreme variation
in hind-leg length between males (Image). Our recent
work showed that males use their hind legs as weapons
during contests, and that long-legged males have sig-
nicantly higher chance to dominate egg-laying sites
and access females (Toubiana and Khila, Proc B. 2019).
We recently identied the gene BMP11 as a primary
regulator of scaling relationships between the body and
the hind-legs in a male-specic manner (Toubiana et
al. PLoS Biology, 2021). We also built the resources re-
quired for this project, including a high-quality genome
and transcriptomes (Toubiana, Armisen et al. BMC
Biology 2021), isogenic lines and lab populations (easy
to keep), DNA methylation datasets, as well as various
developmental genetics tools (Toubiana et al. PLoS
Biology, 2021).
Project: The successful PhD candidate will collaborate
with a team of postdocs and lab technicians studying
how variation in nutritional input causes extreme growth
variation through changes in epigenetic states and tran-
scriptional regulation. The objectives are: - Build the
genome-wide methylome of this species (using Bisulte
sequencing and isogenic lines) - Determine the fraction
of DNA methylation sites that responds to nutritional
treatment - Determine the genes whose expression pro-
les correlate with changes in nutritional treatment and
changes in DNA methylation states. - Functionally test
(by RNAi or Crispr-Cas) a small selection of the loci
identied above.
Mandatory requirement: Master's degree (or equivalent).
- Concepts: Epigenetics, genetic variation, nutritional
manipulation, developmental genetics
Expertise we seek: - DNA methylation analyses, Bioin-
formatics, Statistics, Programming in R Skills: - Good
English (written and spoken), motivation, creativity,
curiosity, good work ethics, team-work, and good inter-
personal relationship with colleagues. - Knowledge in
evolutionary biology, epigenetics or development is a
plus.

coastal ecosystems and are considered a promising
target for a new sustainable aquaculture industry.
While scientic advances in synthetic biology have a
wide application potential to aid macroalgae restoration
and farming, the necessary molecular knowledge is
yet missing for this group of non-model organisms.
This PhD project will apply bioinformatics analy-
ses to exploit a novel resource of >70 brown algal
genomes/transcriptomes in order to characterize the
presence, variation, uniqueness, and evolution of
genomic elements that are relevant to bio-engineering
applications in brown macroalgae, including epigenetic
factors, and transposable elements.
Aims:
1) Identify regulatory regions (e.g. CpG islands), andAugust 1, 2021 EvolDir 23
enzymes (e.g. methyl- transferases) involved in DNA
methylation and histone modications, as well as poten-
tial miRNA target sites, characterize their specicities,
and draw their evolutionary path in the brown macroal-

2) Characterize transposable elements and reconstruct
their evolutionary activity in the sequenced brown al-
gal genomes. This will facilitate the understanding of
genome evolution in brown algae and provide informa-
tion on how these can be harnessed to engineer gene
expression (e.g. via relaxing silencing mechanisms), or
gene function (e.g. via targeted mutational insertion).

PhDstudentship in weed evolutionary ecology
Department of Plant and Environmental Sci-
ences,Faculty of Science, University of Copenhagen,
Denmark.
Description of the scientic environment
The Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences
conducts fundamental research and has a strong focus
on applying basic science to solve real world challenges,
primarily within the plant, soil and environmental sci-
ences. Research and teaching cover natural resources,
agriculture, biotechnology and synthetic biology from
the molecular to landscape scales.
The weed ecology and evolution group investigates the
eco-evolutionary processes that dictate the adaptation
and persistence of weedy and invasive plants in agroe-
cosystems. We have a gene to landscape focus using
approaches from population and evolutionary genet-
ics, evolutionary biology, plant ecology, modelling and
epidemiology and crop science. Our basic research recog-
nises that weedy plants are excellent models for studying
rapid plant adaptation. We apply these insights to de-
velop sustainable weed management strategies using
eco-evolutionary principles.
Project description
Weedy plants can cause more crop yield loss than insectAugust 1, 2021 EvolDir 25
pests and pathogens combined. We still do not fully
understand why some plants evolve tobecome success-
ful weeds, but the ability to rapidly adapt in managed
agricultural habitats is clearly important.Alopecurus
myosuroides(blackgrass) is one of Europe's most trouble-
some weeds, including in Denmark. This PhD addresses
two important questions; (i) why has blackgrass become
a major weed problem in the last 30-40 years in Eu-
rope and (ii) why is the species present as a non-weedy
bystander in other global agroecosystems?
To address these questions, you will have access to a
global collection of weedy and non-weedy blackgrass pop-
ulations and to a recently completed reference genome.
You will conduct classical plant evolutionaryecological
(common garden and reciprocal transplant) eld exper-
iments to measure phenotypic variation in traits that
determine competitiveness and weediness in blackgrass,
comparing these traits in global weedy and non-weedy
populations. You will sample plant tissue, extract high-
quality DNA, and outsource genome sequencing ser-
vices that enable plant genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS).
These sequencing data will be analysed using open-
source population genetics software to explore patterns
of genetic dierentiation within and amongst global
blackgrass populations and to infer patterns of related-
ness, evolution, and dispersal.
As a PhD student in the weed ecology and evolution
group, you will carry out exciting research to answer
questions about the evolution of one of the world's most
economically damaging plants.You will receive training
in plant ecology and evolution, plant molecular biol-
ogy, and statistical population genetics. You will work
closely with postdoctoral scientists in the group (weed
ecology, evolution, and genetics) and collaborate with
the International Weed Genomics Consortium (https:/-

*** Project description - Can biopesticides provide evo-
lutionarily sustainable pest control?
Pathogens provide some of the strongest selection pres-
sures in nature, driving continual dynamic coevolution-
ary interactions with hosts. Because pathogens tend
to show specicity in their ability to infect hosts, ge-
netic variation for resistance to pathogens is typically
high: any one host is unlikely to be able to resist all ex-
tant genotypes of pathogen circulating in a population.
Host-pathogen coevolution is therefore key to funda-
mental questions about how selection shapes diversity,
but it may also provide a tantalising solution to the
long-standing problem of pesticide resistance evolution.
Insect pests consume 10-20% of globally produced food
during growth or in storage, and therefore represent a
substantial threat to global food security. Conventional
pest control using synthetic pesticides can be problem-
atic because it often conicts with other sustainable
development goals by damaging nontarget organisms
and disrupting natural food webs. Moreover, in spite of
intensive research and development, insects continue to
evolve resistance to synthetic pesticides with predictable
regularity, eluding even the most ingenious attempts
to circumvent evolution. Populations of some pests,
such as the cotton boll moth (Helicoverpa armigera),
have evolved resistance to nearly all synthetic pesti-
cides, and can quickly cause signicant economic losses,
while simultaneously prompting the overuse of ineec-
tive chemicals by farmers who are desperate to control
the damage.
Recently, we have proposed an innovative and evolution-
arily sustainable approach to pest control that harnesses
rather than resists the enormous evolutionary potential
of pest populations. It relies on the observation that the
performance of pest genotypes towards genetically com-
plex challenges (e.g., the infective ability of pathogens
and the similarly complex defences of host plants) de-
pends strongly on environmental context. This suggests
that we can preserve genetic diversity for susceptibility
to biological agents by ensuring that pests experience
dierent challenges (both in terms of fungal pathogens
and host plants) at a landscape scale. However, while
we have demonstrated this proof of concept, the long-
term response of pest genetic architecture to constantAugust 1, 2021 EvolDir 27
or variable biopesticides remains unclear.
This PhD project can play a tremendous role in address-
ing one of the most wicked problems confronting sus-
tainable development: the trade-o between abolishing
hunger and preserving healthy environments. It will help
clarify pressing but as yet unanswered questions about
the long-term sustainability of evolutionarily sustainable
pest control, while simultaneously shedding light on fun-
damental questions concerning host-pathogen evolution.
The successful candidate will use a combination of quan-
titative genetic and laboratory evolution experiments
to explore

The Department of Marine Sciences, the Faculty of Sci-
ence, University of Gothenburg, was recently launched
(July 1, 2015) with the purpose to achieve the vision
of \A University with marine research, teaching and
cooperation of the highest international class". The de-
partment has about 110 employees - researchers, teach-
ers, PhD students, technicians and administrators. The
department carries out teaching and research in the
various marine specializations, biology, oceanography,
chemistry, marine geology, conservation of underwater
cultural heritage, and environmental science. Research
is conducted both within specialized individual projects
as well as within larger interdisciplinary programs. The
Department is situated in Gothenburg and at the Uni-
versity's research stations at Tj arn o and Kristineberg.
This position will be based at the Tj arn o Marine Labo-
ratory, 170 km from Gothenburg (https://www.gu.se/-
en/tjarno). More information on the Department canbe found at www.marine.gu.se . Project description
The marine snail, Littorina saxatilis, has ecotypes that
have evolved repeatedly in Sweden, United Kingdom
and Spain, where a high-predation environment leads to
a thick-shelled form and a high wave-action environment
leads to a thin-shelled form. This PhD will be part of
the Swedish Research Council Project: Ecological sys-
tems biology: disentangling the molecular mechanisms
of ecological speciation. The goal of this project is to
identify the genetic mechanisms responsible for these
parallel phenotypes, specically the shell phenotypes.
We will examine the genetics of shell formation between
ecotypes and assess the relative contribution of genetic
vs plastic eects on gene expression in the mantle tis-
sue. We will examine the regulatory architecture using
gene expression, eQTLs, and open chromatin sequenc-
ing (ATACseq). We will synthesize these results along
with other data available from members of the Litto-

I am looking for highly motivated students who are
interested in studying the biology and evolution of mi-
croscopic animals called rotifers. Our team (Dr. Eliza-
beth Walsh and Dr. Jon Mohl, U. Texas El Paso; Dr.
Robert Wallace, Ripon College, WI) is investigating the
evolution of sexuality and life cycle dynamics in the
largest lineage of rotifers, Monogononta. Each team
member is directing dierent forms of research (molecu-
lar, taxonomic, morphological) to achieve a comprehen-
sive understanding of rotifer biodiversity, systematics,
and reproductive evolution in this lineage. Students
will have opportunities to interact with all four team
members through site visits, training, and conferences.
The role of the Hochberg lab in this research will be
to describe the diversity of reproductive morphologies
among rotifers and use this information to answer per-
tinent questions including: 1) Are maternal care and
internal brooding ancestral or derived? 2) Are egg-shell
characteristics (structure, mechanics, chemistry) corre-
lated with life history strategies? 3) Have male genital
and sperm diversity been driven by sexual selection?
4) Has male dwarsm evolved more than once? These
questions and a host of others will be answered us-
ing advanced microscopical techniques including AFM,
CLSM, SEM, TEM, and FIB-SEM. Most research will
be conducted at UML, but some may take place at theU. Massachusetts Medical School, which houses state-
of-the art facilities. Students will have opportunities
to present their research at national conferences and
publish their research in respected zoological journals.
Minimum Requirements & Desirable Qualications (pre-

{ Left-right asymmetry in Hawaiian ' ^A¥Looking-glass' ^A
snails
About the Project
While most animal bodies are bilaterally symmetric on
the outside, the internal organs usually show a con-
sistent left-right (LR) asymmetry. Dening this LR
asymmetry is a critical part of early development, such
that left/right positional errors are an important class of
human birth defect, and in later life numerous diseases
aect apparently symmetric organs in an asymmetric
fashion. Yet, in trying to understand how this LR asym-
metry is established, it is straightforward to conceive
how the LR axis is dened relative to front/back and
top/bottom, but more dicult to comprehend how left
and right are consistently orientated in the same di-
rection. In the classic view, the solution is that LR
asymmetry is signalled by a chiral structure, the fabled
\F-molecule", which is directionally orientated relative
to the other axes.
To date, a wealth of studies have revealed the genes
that promote the propagation of asymmetric signals,
but the earliest LR symmetry-breaking events are not
clear. In seeking to understand if there is a common
pathway, an emerging consensus is that LR asymmetry
in diverse organisms originates from the cytoskeletal
dynamics that underlie the asymmetric behaviour of
individual cells Nonetheless, a central problem remains
'V how and why are left and right consistently orientated32 EvolDir August 1, 2021
in the same direction? The main approach to under-
standing this invariance has been to use rare mutants
or manipulations in model animals (vertebrates, nema-
tode/y), to create individuals that are partly or wholly
orientated in the opposite direction. This methodology
has been fruitful, of course, but unfortunately, scientists
have largely ignored the only animal group 'V snails
'V in which ordinary development can produce indi-
viduals that are LR orientated in dierent directions.
Studies of LR asymmetry (\chirality") in snails may be
key to understanding how and why are left and right
consistently orientated in the same direction in nearly
all other animals. In this project, we propose to use
association mapping and long read genome sequencing
to identify the gene that underpins natural variation
in the LR asymmetry of Hawaiian snails of the genus
Lymnaea or Auricullela. This knowledge will then be
used to understand how molecular chirality denes the
LR asymmetry of cells, organs and bodies, with implica-
tions for understanding human health and development.
The project will involve a range of evolutionary genomic
methods, including DNA sequencing / bioinformatics,
and may also require eld or lab work in Hawaii.

PhD or Post-doc : Demography of tree swallows: ex-
plaining the contemporary decline of an aerial insecti-

Many species of birds have shown decline in abun-
dance in North America. Most worrisome among
them are aerial insectivores. For example, tree swallow
(Tachycineta bicolor) abundance has declined by 4.2 %
per year over the past 20 years in Qu ebec. The goal
of this project will be to expand a demographic model
on tree swallow population dynamics, to integrate both
local and global environment drivers and to quantify
the relative role of these factors in driving the observed
decline and forecast future population trends. The data
available for this project come from a long-term indi-
vidual monitoring of tree swallows in southern Qu ebec,
where survival and reproduction have been monitored
in 400 nesting boxes since 2004.
Assets for this position include publications, a 'basic'
knowledge of French (or a strong willingness to learn
it), eldwork experience, strong quantitative skills (e.g.

Interindividual variation of the response to thermal con-
strains: from underlying
mechanisms to evolutionary consequences.
The human footprint, including global changes, and
their eects on ecosystems, is growing and widespread.
Our ability to quantify and predict the magnitude of
these eects represents one of the major challenges of
21st century. While climate change is characterized
by a gradual increase of ambient temperature through
time, it is also leading to an increased frequency of
climate anomalies, such as heat waves, especially in
urban areas. Strikingly, even small changes in ambient
temperature within the ZNT of individuals can have
signicant eects on the performance of organisms. In
birds, environmental parameters experienced during de-
velopment and growth, including temperature, are of
crucial importance and can have a signicant inuence
on individuals' physiology and life history trajectories.
However, relatively few studies have investigated the
physiological and molecular mechanisms which underlie
these eects and their consequences on the life history
trajectories in individuals. Performing energetically
costly activities (growth, reproduction, maintenance)
under warm ambient temperatures might expose indi-
viduals to a risk of hyperthermia. This can lead to a
reduced investment in such energetically-costly activities
and may lead to reduced reproductive investment and
success. Alternatively, organisms might maintain their
energy investment in those essential activities under
warm temperatures but suer from various physiologi-
cal costs related to heat stress. Moreover, thermal stress
eects during development and / or growth can have
transgenerational eects. Finally, the parents would
change quickly their behaviour at the nest according
the environment change. To expand our understanding
of how bird species respond to temperature variation,
we will investigate if parents can adjust the microcli-
mate around the nestlings. Using a multidisciplinary
and integrative approach, the aim of this project is to
evaluate the eects of thermal disturbances on the phys-
iology of organisms, in order to better understand and
predict their ability to adapt to these eects, but also
to determine their potential eects at the scale of life
history trajectories.
Experiments To do so, we propose to set up two exper-
iments, one in natura on the Great tit (Parus major)
and in a controlled lab environment on the Zebra nch
(Taeniopygia guttata), to address the following ques-
tions: 1) What are the eects of thermal disturbance onorganisms' physiology? We will identify the underlying
mechanisms involved in thermal adaptation by using
crossing-over method (chick swap) between dierent
sites. 2) What is the impact on individuals' life history
trajectories? We will study evolutionary consequences
of thermal disturbances. 3) What is the impact of ther-
mal disturbance during the growth of nestlings? We will
plan a "mis-match\ experiment by modify temperature
during prenatal development and postnatal growth of
nestlings and evaluate the physiological and life history
traits eects. 4) How parents adjust their parental ef-
fort during the thermo-dependence period of nestlings
according to the temperature variation? We have to
control if the time-budget of the parents linked to nest
activities change to buer the temperature increase.
Physiological and molecular parameters To assess the
impact on metabolism, we will measure metabolic activ-
ity in a portable metabolic chamber and mitochondrial
density. To assess lifestyle eects and their impact on
individuals' health, oxidative stress, telomere dynamics,
and corticosterone will be measured. Oxidative stress
will be evaluated from plasma samples with measures
of oxidative damage (global and oxidative damage on
DNA) and antioxidant defences (non-enzymatic OXY
capacity and enzymatic superoxide dismutase activity).
Telomere lengths are measured from blood samples by
qPCR. From the same DNA extracted from these blood
samples, mitochondrial density will be measured by
qPCR as

**Ph.D. student position in molecular evolution**
Are you intrigued by the still elusive link between
genome evolution, natural selection, and species adap-
tation? Then, this Ph.D. position and excellent Ph.D.
program might be a good t for you:
Topic: Molecular evolution of coding sequences
Advisors: Rui Borges (Vetmeduni Vienna) and Carolin
Kosiol (University of St. Andrews)
Description: A major goal in evolutionary biology is to
understand the forces that operate in the genomic se-August 1, 2021 EvolDir 35
quences and are responsible for the adaptation of species
to dierent environments. Codon models are one of the
main tools used to infer selection on protein-coding
genes. These have been popularized in comparative
genomic studies by their extensive use in genome-wide
scans of natural selection. However, current models of
codon evolution have signicant limitations that are
increasingly being recognized. The main one being
that current codon models make simplistic assumptions
about the evolutionary process: e.g., uctuating de-
mography and GC-biased gene conversion. This Ph.D.
project seeks to develop a new codon evolution model to
detect signatures of natural selection on protein-coding
sequences. By properly reconciling the neutral and
adaptive processes by which coding sequences evolve,
the models and methods developed in this project will
allow us to tell apart the sole action of natural selec-
tion from known confounding forces. This project will
ultimately contribute to better understanding the dy-
namics of adaptation during species divergence. More

PlantMicrobeInteractions
The Porter lab at Washington State University seeks
an MS student to join in investigating how wildre and
drought alter soil microbiomes and soil hydrology to
facilitate or inhibit tree regeneration after re. Over two
years, the student will have the opportunity to study
post-re tree seedling regeneration and soil microbiomes
using a greenhouse experiment and amplicon sequencing.
Prior experience in Evolutionary Ecology, Environmen-
tal Science, Microbiology, Plant Science, or Bioinfor-
matics would be useful. The successful candidate will
join a collaborative WSU research team spanning plant-
microbe interactions (Porter lab), ecohydrology (Moett
lab), and restoration ecology (Cheeke lab), so strong
communication skills are a plus.
Project Background. Wildre and climate change pose
a risk of widespread forest conversion to shrub- or grass-
lands. This conversion has already occurred in many
locations around the world, but the contributing mecha-
nisms remain a puzzling and active area of research. Key
aspects of forest resilience, such as soil microbial ecol-
ogy and hydraulic function, are critical drivers of tree
seedling survival and drought tolerance. However, re's
impact on microbial and physical components of soils
are rarely tested for their combined eects on post-re
regeneration and drought tolerance, especially outsideof boreal forests. We aim to disentangle the disruptions
that re imposes on temperate montane conifer forest
seedling-microbe-soil feedbacks at the microscopic scale
and any impacts on seedling drought tolerance.
Lab Description. The Porter lab (https://labs.wsu.edu/-
stephanie-porter/) investigates diverse projects on the
Evolutionary Ecology of Plant-Microbe Interactions,
ranging from how symbiotic plants and microbes adapt
to environmental stresses to the ways in which plant-
microbe cooperation shifts during crop domestication.
We are housed in the School of Biological Sciences at
Washington State University, Vancouver. The student
will also have the opportunity to engage with Vancou-
ver's Moett lab on themes of water-soil-plant interac-
tions in diverse settings, including post-re systems.
Located on a beautiful 351-acre campus across the
Columbia River from Portland, Oregon, WSU Vancou-
ver oers an excellent quality of life. Recognized by
Insight Into Diversity Magazine as a top college for
diversity, WSUV and this collaborative project team
commit to inclusive excellence by advancing equity and
diversity in all that we do.
How to Apply. A BS or BA in a relevant scientic
eld is required. Tuition, benets, and stipend will
be funded by a combination of research and teaching
assistantships, guaranteed for two years. If interested,
please email an inquiry with the subject header, \Plant-
Microbe-Fire MS" with CV, GPA, relevant experience
and coursework, and a short statement explaining your
interest in the position to stephanie.porter@wsu.edu.
Application review will begin on May 30th, 2021, and
continue until the position is lled. Position could begin
as soon as July 1st, 2021. For more information about

RegulatoryGenomics
We are posting two exciting opportunities to join our
eort to understand the non-coding regulatory genome
in adaptation using threespine stickleback sh.
- Sta scientist in genomics (see below) - Postdoc in
Genomics and Epigenomics of Gene Regulation (see ad
under \Postdoc")
A major challenge in the eld is understanding how
the non-coding genome functions in natural popula-
tions under dierent environmental conditions. In our
group we combine state-of-the-art facilities to manipu-
late environmental conditions and have been collecting
a trove of chromatin, epigenomic and transcriptomic
data from adaptively divergent stickleback sh ecotypes
to map and quantify how the non-coding regulatory
genome functions and evolves. In previous work we
have shown the predominance of cis-regulatory dier-ences in gene expression divergence (Jones et al 2012[1],
Verta et al., eLife 2019, [2]), tracked allelic trajectories
during adaptation over time (ancient DNA, Kirch et
al., Curr Biol. 2021 [3], Kingman et al., Sci. Advances,
in press/bioRxiv [4]. and Schluter et al., PNAS, 2020
[5]) and developed novel techniques to determine the
recombination landscape in single individuals (Dreau
et al., Nat Comm. 2019 [6]). We have recently gener-
ated a large multi-tissue, multi-omic dataset dubbed
\StickleCODE" [unpub] to further dissect the molecu-
lar mechanism of adaptation (including environmental
manipulations) in the system.
We are looking for a sta scientist to join as a core
member of our team and support projects central to
our groups' overall aims. You will actively generate ge-
nomic data in the molecular lab and/or apply pipelines
in bioinformatic analysis of 'omic datasets. You will also
provide research support to other team members. The
successful candidate will have previous experience in
areas related to gene regulation, genomics, epigenomics
and evolution; and some experience with data analysis
and bioinformatics (e.g., familiarity with Unix/linux,
bash, Python, R).
The Max Planck T ubingen Campus is a leading research
hub with world-class genomics and machine learning ex-
pertise. Our sequencing core features Illumina, PacBio
and 10X Genomics platforms. English is the working

OriginOfSarsCoV2
Dear colleagues,
We are recruiting a \Research Engineer" (with a scien-
tic PhD) in bioinformatics and molecular evolution for
1 year, with possible renewal of 1 year.
The last intermediate step between a non-human ani-
mal virus and the current human SARS-CoV-2 is still a
major enigma. More precisely, i) the evolution from the
ancestral (very likely bat) virus to the human strain, ii)
the transport from tropical Yunnan bat caves to Wuhan
more than 1000 km away, and iii) the contamination of
the rst human, are three distinct aspects of the prox-
imal origin on which we have little to no information.
Each aspect could, in various proportions, result from
contributions due to natural, accidental or intentional
mechanisms. Determining these contributions requires
an observation-based scientic approach free of a priori.
We propose a state-of-the-art analysis of the available se-
quences of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses, to examine
whether the identity of the virus (bat-adapted/human-
adapted, natural/articial) has changed across genera-
tions. The expected outputs of this work are not only
scientic publication(s), but more importantly scien-
tic insights on the origin of the ongoing pandemic and
therefore hints on how to prevent a future pandemic.
The work will be organized in order to develop open sci-
ence bioinformatic tools in order to allow the inclusion
of new sequence data in the analysis when available. We
will investigate both small-scale and large-scale changes:
synonymous and non- synonymous mutations, inser-
tions/deletions of small or large sequence pieces, and -
nally recombinations of fragments from dierent viruses,
as recombination is a key mechanism of coronavirus
evolution.

The ideal candidate (1) will be familiar with concepts
of molecular evolution (i.e. phylogeny, detection of
recombination, ratio of non-synonymous/synonymous
mutations, codon usage, etc.) and (2) will have skills
in computer programming (e.g. python 3, R and/or C
language).46 EvolDir August 1, 2021
Salary: around 2 500 euro /month with taxes ( ~1 925

tions might be considered.
To apply, send a letter of motivation and a
scientic CV to virginie.courtier@ijm.fr and guil-

scholars across UCSD disciplines to address issues of
race and racism, access and equity, and social and polit-
ical inuences focused on STEM/Public Health/Health
Sciences, while also working within their home depart-
ments and professional communities.
Faculty holding these positions will be expected to de-
sign and teach undergraduate courses that align with
the African American Studies Minor (AASM). They
may also demonstrate the equivalent through service to
the AASM and by mentoring undergraduate students.
We seek candidates whose research, teaching, and/or
service advance anti-racism, anti-oppression, equity, and
justice in STEM/Public Health/Health Sciences. We
welcome candidates whose experiences have facilitated
their understandings of traditionally underrepresented
racial minority communities. Faculty are expected to

Cell & Developmental Biology: Areas of study include
mechanistic analysis at multiple levels of: cell structure
and function, the developmental biology of multicellular
organisms, cutting-edge investigations into plant biology,
and pathogenesis. Ecology, Behavior, & Evolution:Areas
of study are focused on investigating ecological and evo-
lutionary processes operating at the level of individuals,
populations, species, and communities. Molecular Bi-
ology: Areas of study include the mechanisms of gene
expression and function at the cellular and organismal
levels, the study of normal and pathogenic microbes,
and the study of immunology.
Neurobiology: Areas of interest include multi-level anal-
ysis of brain circuits, neural networks, sensory receptors,
neurotransmitter regulation, and computational models
of behavior.
Strong candidates will have a research agenda easily

Two projects will be selected and funded for a period of
three years, including: the recruitment of a post-doctoral
fellow based in Brazil and working on the project for two
years, the organization of four meetings (two in France,at CESAB in Montpellier and two in in Brazil in the
state of S ao Paulo) and the promotion and publication
of the results. Logistical, technical and administrative
support will also be provided.
The submitted projects can be in the elds of natural sci-
ences and/or social and human sciences and should aim
at developing the synthesis of ideas and concepts and/or
the analysis of existing data. The call is restricted to
terrestrial biomes only (i.e., excluding marine biology)
and to tropical South America, Central America and/or

Eelpout samples
Dear EvolDir community,
We are seeking eelpout (sh in the family Zoarcidae)
samples for genome sequencing and comparative genome
biology. We are specically interested in samples from
non-polar latitudes (roughly 60 ^AoN to 60 ^AoS). Since
we plan to do long-read sequencing (e.g., PacBio), it is
important that samples have been suciently stored for
extraction of high-molecular weight DNA. For instance,
a ash frozen tissue that has been stored at -80 ^Aois
ideal.
We have funding to cover shipping costs, sample prep,
and sequencing. We would also welcome those with
tissues as collaborators on manuscripts. If you have
tissue(s) you'd be willing to share or other ideas for
how we can obtain them, please email Joanna Kelley at
joanna.l.kelley@wsu.edu.
Thank you!

JMolEvol ClassicPapers
EVOLDIR reported (March 4th) that for an issue cele-
brating the half century of the Journal of Molecular
Evolution, ten members of its editorial board each
gave their personal historical perspective on a clas-
sic paper from the journal and the research it subse-
quently spawned. These were made available at https:/-
/www.springer.com/journal/239/updates/18894136 to-
gether with links to the original paper referenced. One
of these classics (JME 44:632-636) described the epic
clash on the pages of the journal (1995) between the
neutralist ideas of Naboru Sueoka and the selectionist
ideas of Donald Forsdyke. The latter has now issued
an update (see Genetica 149(2):81-88; https://rdcu.be/-

Passing Marty Tracey
Dear colleagues,
Friends and colleagues mourn the passing of popula-
tion geneticist, Martin L. Tracey, on February 23, 2021.
Marty was born in Brookline, MA, March 3, 1943. He
received his PhD under the supervision of Professor
Masatoshi Nei, then at Brown University, where he
developed a life-long interest in the roles of sex chro-
mosomes and mating behavior in speciation. He did
postdoctoral research at the University of California
Davis, rst with Professor Francisco J. Ayala, where he
contributed to an understanding of genetic divergence
during the speciation process in the Drosophila willis-
toni group, and then with Professor Robert A. Shleser,
where, at the Bodega Marine Laboratory, he did seminal58 EvolDir August 1, 2021
work on the genetics of marine invertebrates. He held
faculty positions at Brock University and at Florida
International University. Over the last two decades of
his career, he developed a strong interest in the use
of DNA as forensic evidence and served as an expert
witness in hundreds of cases.

BolzanoItaly BarkbeetleMicrobiome
A Postdoctoral position is being oered at the Free Uni-
versity of Bozen-Bolzano (Italy) in the lab of Hannes
Schuler. The project is funded for one year renewable
for six months and aims to study the microbial and
fungal community of the European spruce bark beetle
Ips typographus.
The European spruce bark beetle Ips typographus is
one of the most important forest pests in Europe. In
addition to factors such as a high fecundity and the
establishment of several generations per year, symbiotic
associations with fungi and bacteria are responsible for
its potential to cause forest mortality. The focus of this
project is to study the associations of Central European
bark beetle populations with symbiotic bacteria and
fungi to obtain a more holistic understanding of the
biology, ecology and harmful potential of this impor-
tant pest species. The project is in collaboration with
Martin Schebeck and Christian Stauer (Boku, Vienna)
and Massimo Faccoli and Andrea Battisti (University
of Padova).
We are looking for an enthusiastic candidate with a
strong background in molecular biology and experience
with bioinformatic analyses of bacterial and/or fungal
communities associated with insects. The candidate
will be responsible to develop an amplicon-sequencing
approach for fungi optimized for this species and per-
form PacBio full-length amplicon sequencing of both
mycobiome and bacterial microbiome.
The Free University of Bozen-Bolzano is located in one
of the most fascinating European regions, at the cross-
roads between the German-speaking and Italian cul-
tures. Its trilingualism in teaching and research, its
high level of internationalization as well as an ideal
research environment guaranteed by its excellent fa-
cilities are some of the reasons why unibz regularly
reaches top positions in national and international rank-
ings. Our lab is part of the newly funded compe-
tence Centre for Plant Health within the Departmentof Science and Technology https://www.unibz.it/en/-
home/research/competence-centre-plant-health. We are
a young and dynamic research group studying various
aspects of insect-microbe interactions in a collaborative
atmosphere http://hschuler.people.unibz.it General re-
quirements for the position: A PhD degree in Biology or
Evolution or related elds. The candidate should have
excellent communication skills and should be uent in
English.
The project is expected to start in August 2021, but
the starting date is negotiable.
Application deadline is 11.06.2021

Palaeogenomics
POSTDOC IN DEEPTIME PALAEOGENOMICS
The Centre for Palaeogenetics is looking to hire a post-
doctoral researcher in palaeogenomics. The main goal
of the project is to recover and analyze genome-wide
data from specimens that range in age from one hundred
thousand and up more than one million years old. The
analyses will be aimed at developing a better under-
standing of evolutionary processes in wild mammals,
such as speciation, introgression and adaptation. The
primary methods used in the project will be ancient
DNA laboratory analysis of prehistoric bones and teeth,
as well as advanced computational analyses of the result-
ing data. The research group working on this project
is international and interdisciplinary. The postdoc will
be based in Love Dal en's research group at the Cen-
tre for Palaeogenetics (www.palaeogenetics.com), which
is a joint venture between Stockholm University and
the Swedish Museum of Natural History. The research
group working on this project is international and inter-
disciplinary.WORK TASKS
The position is mainly directed towards research, includ-
ing recovering and and analyzing ancient genetic data
collected with high-throughput DNA sequencing. It is
also expected that the successful applicant will partici-
pate in the daily activities at the Centre for Palaeoge-
netics.
QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS
Postdoctoral positions are appointed primarily for pur-
poses of research. Applicants are expected to hold a
Swedish doctoral degree or an equivalent degree from
another country.
ASSESSMENT CRITERIA
The degree should have been completed no more than
three years before the deadline for applications. An
older degree may be acceptable under special circum-
stances, which may involve sick leave, parental leave,
clinical attachment, elected positions in trade unions,
or similar.

Job Summary: We are seeking three Postdoctoral Re-
search Associate positions in computational ecology.
The project is to create a virtual rainforest: a general
ecosystem model replicating all physical and biotic com-
ponents of the ecosystem and their interactions, with
a view to understanding system-level emergent proper-
ties. We are particularly interested in nding applicants
with an interest in systems ecology and experience in
process-based modelling. However, this project requires
team members who provide complementary and diverse
technical skills and disciplinary knowledge, so applicants
from any ecological background and/or with any rel-
evant skillset are encouraged to apply. Positions are
open to full or part-time applicants, and you will be
given time, resources and encouragement to pursue your
professional development.
Project Description: We are building a team to create
a virtual rainforest: a general ecosystem model replicat-
ing all physical and biotic components of the ecosystem
and their interactions, with a view to understandingsystem-level emergent properties. The virtual rainforest
will link all of the biotic and abiotic system components
through nutrient cycling, stoichiometric and metabolic
processes. It will track the birth, growth and death of
cohorts of plant, animal and soil microbial functional
groups, and the movement of carbon, nitrogen, phos-
phorus, water and energy through the ecosystem. At its
heart, the virtual rainforest will be an individual-based
simulation of plants, animals, microbes and their inter-
actions with the abiotic environment, and which rests
upon the key individual-based processes of metabolism,
respiration, reproduction and mortality. The virtual
rainforest will be used to gain insight into the processes
that govern three key, emergent properties of rainforests:
their stability, resilience and sustainability.
Ecosystems cannot be understood through piecemeal
studies of their individual components. The disci-
pline of tropical forest ecology has at its disposal ever-
accumulating datasets examining all aspects of rain-
forest ecosystems giving insight into everything from
the population dynamics of plants through to the scav-
enging behaviour of ants. This knowledge allows us to
understand much of how the ecosystem operates and
the ecosystem services it generates, but in a disjointed
fashion. As a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Com-
putational Ecology, you will be part of an attempt to
tie that knowledge into a single, comprehensive under-
standing of how the ecosystem operates in its entirety.
Duties and responsibilities:
The primary role of successful applicants will be to de-
velop one of the four modules of the virtual rainforest:
plant, animal, soil microbial or abiotic processes. You
will be assisted in this by additional team members,
including your peers, a separately appointed scientic
programmer and postgraduate students. The project
provides a generous budget for placements and second-
ments to give you the freedom to work with, and harness
the expertise of, research groups beyond our own. The
virtual rainforest will lean heavily on data collected
from the SAFE Project (www.safeproject.net), and you
will be required to help with the management of these
datasets. All team members will be expected to help de-
velop the skills and competencies of their peers through
the sharing of tasks and knowledge. As part of a research
group and environment that extends beyond the virtual
rainforest team, you will contribute to the supervision
of undergraduate and postgraduate student projects.
You will be given time, resources and encouragement
to pursue your professional development, along with
opportunities to gain teaching experience in the form of
tutorials, lectures, practical classes and eld trips.
Essential requirements: We require team members whoAugust 1, 2021 EvolDir 67
provide complementary technical skills and disciplinary
knowledge, so applicants from any ecological background
and with any relevant skillset are encouraged to apply.
No individual team member is expected to have more
than a small subset of this list of topics and skills, and we
specically encourage applicants to clearly identify the
subset of skills that they could bring to the team. Among
the team members, we will need understanding of plant,
animal and microbial ecology, along with functional
ecology, metabolic ecology, ecological stoichiometry, bio-
geochemistry, hydrology and microclimate processes.
Candidates with an interest in systems ecology and the
concepts of stability, resilience and sustainability are
particularly encouraged to apply. Some programming
experience - preferably in Python - is necessary for all
applicants. Experience with either process-based or nu-
meric simulation modelling is desirable, as is experience
with error propagation and ecological statistics. We are
also seeking experience with version

AdaptationGenomics
PostDoc:Krakow JagiellonianU. Adaptation Genomics
We are looking for a postdoctoral researcher to join
Genomics and Experimental Evolution Group at Jagiel-
lonian University, Institute of Environmental Sciences.
The position is oered for two years and is funded from
the Polish National Science Centre grant Environment-
dependent balancing selection in a gene involved in
sexual conict. The position is available from autumn,
but the starting date is exible. Institute of Environmen-
tal Sciences, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland
(www.eko.uj.edu.pl/en) is one of the strongests centres
of research in evolutionary biology in Central Europe.
Krakow is a beautiful medieval city with a rich history
and a lively cultural life.
The project The maintenance of genetic variation, en-
abling populations to adapt to novel environments, is
one of the greatest puzzles in evolutionary biology, be-
cause ubiquitous directional selection should lead to
depletion of genetic variation in selected traits. This
is especially the case with sexually selected traits, in
which directional selection is particularly strong. Yet,
substantial genetic variance in these traits is maintained.
A potent force proposed to maintain genetic variation
is balancing selection, but cases of a detailed dissec-
tion of the mechanisms of that maintain balanced poly-
morphisms are extremely rare. The project will likely
provide a textbook example of balancing selection in
action.
We aim to investigate the maintenance of polymorphism
in Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6Pgdh), a sexually
selected gene associated with sexual conict in the bulb
mite Rhizoglyphus robini. 6Pgdh polymorphism (with
two alleles, S and F) is associated with dierences in
male reproductive success. The S-bearers have advan-
tage in male-male competition, but decrease fecundity
of their partners. Previous studies suggest that the
nonsynonymous polymorphism dening F and S alleles
is under (relatively) long-term environment-dependent
balancing selection. The project is aimed at identifying
mechanisms driving this selection and investigating its
molecular signitures.
Responsibilities A PostDoc will look for the molecular
signatures of balancing selection around the 6Pgdh geneAugust 1, 2021 EvolDir 69
and attempt to estimate the age of the 6Pgdh. We
expect a strong signal of long-term balancing selection
within the genomic region centered on the F/S dening
nonsynonymous polymorphism. The PostDoc will also
be involved in gathering/analyzing eld data to evaluate
the levels of 6Pgdh polymorphism in natural populations
and determine environmental factors aecting 6Pgdh
allele frequencies in the eld. This second task will be
realized with the cooperation of a PhD student and PI.
Requirements
The successful candidate will have a PhD in biology,
or other relevant eld acquired no sooner than in 2014.
The candidate will have experience in the analyses of
population genomics data, including searching for the
signals of balancing selection in the genome. We are
looking for a candidate with a strong publication record,
strong background in Evolutionary Biology and skills
in data analysis. Excellent English, organizational and
communication skills are also required.
Salary
The salary is 100 000 PLN/year gross (ca. 23000 euro;
before taxes and insurances). Note that living costs in
Poland are substantially lower than in the west of the
EU, so this amount of money ensures a suciently good
life standard.
Documents
Please send a CV including contact details for two
references and a cover letter to Agata Plesnar-Bielak
(agata.plesnar@uj.edu.pl). The applications should be
sent until June 10 th 2021. For more information, please

RegulatoryGenomics
We are posting two exciting opportunities to join our

in adaptation using threespine stickleback sh.
- Postdoc in Genomics and Epigenomics of Gene Regu-
lation (see below) - Sta scientist in genomics (see ad
posted under \Jobs")
A major challenge in the eld is understanding how
the non-coding genome functions in natural popula-
tions under dierent environmental conditions. In our
group we combine state-of-the-art facilities to manipu-
late environmental conditions and have been collecting
a trove of chromatin, epigenomic and transcriptomic
data from adaptively divergent stickleback sh ecotypes
to map and quantify how the non-coding regulatory
genome functions and evolves. In previous work we
have shown the predominance of cis-regulatory dier-
ences in gene expression divergence (Jones et al 2012[1],
Verta et al., eLife 2019, [2]), tracked allelic trajectories
during adaptation over time (ancient DNA, Kirch et
al., Curr Biol. 2021 [3], Kingman et al., Sci. Advances,
in press/bioRxiv [4]. and Schluter et al., PNAS, 2020
[5]) and developed novel techniques to determine the
recombination landscape in single individuals (Dreau
et al., Nat Comm. 2019 [6]). We have recently gener-
ated a large multi-tissue, multi-omic dataset dubbed
\StickleCODE" [unpub] to further dissect the molecu-
lar mechanism of adaptation (including environmental
manipulations) in the system.
We are looking for a motivated postdoc to join our team
to both analyze our rich set of genomic data (RNA-,
ATAC- and ChIP- and CHRO-seq, including from single-
cell platforms) and develop and lead new projects inves-
tigating evolutionary divergence in regulatory genome
function using cutting edge techniques such as single
cell 'omics, spatial transcriptomics and 3D genomics.

Post-doctoral position in association genetics and func-

A 2-year post-doctoral position is available in the
Cereal Roots Systems team at the French Na-
tional Research Institute for Sustainable Development
(IRD)/Montpellier University in Montpellier, France
(http://diade.ird.fr/en/teams/ceres-team.html). This
post-doctoral position is open in the frame of an ANR
project that will explore adaptive root plasticity in re-
sponse to drought in pearl millet in close collaboration
with the DYNADIV team of IRD Montpellier (http:/-
/diade.ird.fr/en/teams/dynadiv-team.html), and two
teams in Senegal and the UK.
Pearl millet is key for food security in arid and semi-
arid regions of West Africa and India. In these regions,
increased extreme climatic events due to climate change
(dry spells and heat waves in particular) are threatening
pearl millet cultivation and varieties more adapted to
climate uncertainties are needed. Root plastic traits
could improve the plant ability to adapt to these con-
ditions by stabilizing yield only under extreme events
without negative trade-o in the absence of stress.
The work of the post-doc will aim at identifying the
genetic determinants controlling adaptive root plasticity
in pearl millet. Original approaches will be developed
to calculate root plasticity and correlate this plasticity
with agronomical traits. Association genetics (GWAS)
combined with functional genomics approaches will be
deployed to identify new QTLs/genes controlling plas-
ticity of key root traits.
We are seeking a highly motivated and independent
postdoc with skills in molecular biology and genetics
with basic knowledge in quantitative genetics, R and
command-line interface. The candidate should have
good writing and communication skills, and be com-
fortable working in a collaborative, multi-disciplinary

Postdoc: Modeling Gene Drive and Evolution of Insec-
ticide Resistance in Mosquitoes
OVERVIEW: We have funding from NIH for a project
titled \Combining Aedes aegypti genomics and modeling
to improve gene drive strategies and our understanding
of insecticide resistance evolution". Aedes aegypti is
the primary vector of dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and
urban yellow-fever. We are searching for a postdoc to
work on the modeling aspects of the project.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The idea of using self-
ish genetic elements to drive specic transgenes into
a mosquito population either to reduce its size or to
render it unable to transmit a particular pathogen was
proposed over 40 years ago. It is only recently, however,
with the advent of CRISPR-based gene editing tech-
nology, that this approach has gained broad attention
from researchers and the news media. The need for thisnew technology is in part due to evolution of mosquito
resistance to insecticides.
The most straightforward approaches for building gene
drives using CRISPR/Cas9 technologies are theoreti-
cally expected to result in spread of the gene drive to
individuals in all populations that are connected by
even minimal gene ow. These approaches are appro-
priate in some cases, but detailed mathematical models
are needed to understand the dynamics of spread and
the potential for resistance evolving to the gene drive
mechanisms. Our group and others have proposed more
complex approaches for developing gene drives that are
spatially and/or temporally limited. Novel molecular
approaches accompanied by modeling are needed for
development of these limited gene drives.
We currently have a detailed spatial model that simu-
lates the population dynamics and population genetics
of Ae. aegypti in a city, Iquitos, in the Amazonian re-
gion of Peru. There are rich data sets on both mosquito
dynamics and dengue epidemiology that have been col-
lected in this city. One important characteristic of this
mosquito is limited among house movement and strong
population structure. A main goal of our NIH grant
is to modify this model to explore how and to what
extent population structure will impact insecticide resis-
tance evolution and the performance of novel gene drive
strategies.

ics in natural populations: the importance of density-

JOB DESCRIPTION: The postdoc in this position will
lead eorts on modifying the detailed model and uti-
lizing it to test hypotheses. The postdoc will have the
option of also conceptualizing and developing general
models to evaluate novel approaches for building spa-
tially/temporally limited gene drives. Our project is
strengthened by collaborations with a number of labs in
the US and in Peru, and activity in the Genetic Engi-
neering and Society Center at NC State that examines
societal aspects of novel genetic technologies. The post-
doc will interact with members of these other research
groups. If desired, there will be an opportunity for some
work in Peru and for mentoring undergraduate and grad-
uate students. The appointment is for two-years with
the potential to write new grants for extension beyond
that period.

Cluster hire of multiple postdoc and PhD positions to
work on the Blue-Green Biodiversity (BGB2021-2024)
research initiative of Eawag and WSL
The loss of biodiversity is, next to climate change, one of
the biggest challenges humanity is facing. Research and
action to reverse and mitigate the loss of biodiversity
and associated ecosystem functions and services are thus
crucially needed. In order to tackle this scientically
and societally urgent topic, the ETH Board has funded
a research program on Blue-Green Biodiversity (BGB,
www.eawag.ch/bgb and www.wsl.ch/bgb). Its goal is
to strengthen interdisciplinary biodiversity research of
WSL and Eawag in order to nd answers to urgent social
challenges of species loss as quickly as possible.
The BGB program started in 2020, with a series of
projects. In its second phase, from 2021-2024, the pro-
gram is now funding a series of projects including both
postdoctoral and PhD student positions. All of these
positions will be set in a highly collaborative framework
at both institutions. Postdocs and PhD students will
be employed at WSL or Eawag and will prot from a
highly dynamic and international research community
in biodiversity, ecology, evolution, environmental and
social sciences.
The funded projects belong to a research or implementa-
tion track, respectively. Candidates for all positions will
be selected to ensure strong complementarity among
projects. We are also very committed to hire people
from a diverse background, ensuring cultural, ethnic,
and gender diversity. We invite interested candidates
with a background and interest in biodiversity sciences
(ecology, evolution) or related elds to apply. Post-
doc positions are generally funded for two years. PhD
positions are funded for four years, and will be accom-
panied with enrollment at a degree granting university
(e.g., ETHZ, UZH, UniBE). Generally, positions are
expected to be lled this summer. Salary and benets
are very competitive. Candidates interested in multi-
ple positions can apply for several projects, but should
cross-reference this in their applications. Details about
individual projects can be found at the respective links;
questions can be addressed to the respective project
leaders. Both WSL and Eawag oer unique research
and working environment and are committed to pro-moting equal opportunities for women and men and
to support the compatibility of family and work. For

PopulationAdaptationGenomics
Background Info: Research in the Whitehead lab
(https://whiteheadresearch.wordpress.com/) focuses on
evolutionary change in human-altered environments. We
seek applicants for a Postdoctoral Research Associate
to study population genetic change through space and
time in Pacic herring. The causes of the collapse of the
Prince William Sound (PWS) Pacic herring stock are
controversial, and the reasons for the lack of recovery
remain a mystery. We hypothesize that interactions
between the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill and a subse-
quent viral epidemic were inuential. We have collected
whole genome sequences from ~1,300 individual sh
from across Alaska and across time (four times span-ning three decades), and throughout the rest of their
range, to explore genomic change associated with the
collapse and the period since; with these data we seek
to explore and test hypotheses about the causes and
consequences of the collapse, and test hypotheses about
the genetic basis of parallel local adaptation. This huge
population genomics dataset is ready for the right can-
didate to make rapid progress. Data are collected, and
curated; we have a ltered variant data set where sum-
mary population genetics statistics have been estimated.
Collaborations are in place with scientists in academia
and with State and Federal agencies. The ideal candi-
date has experience in population genetics, statistical
genetics, and computational biology. We are especially
interested in candidates with a passion for open science
and for connecting their work to decision makers, the
public, and the broader conservation biology and evolu-
tionary biology communities. There is funding for one
year, with possibility of extension. We are open to the
candidate working remotely. Our group is committed
to creating a safe, inclusive, diverse, optimistic, and
equitable work environment.
Responsibilities: Contribution to analysis strategy, code
development, data analysis and interpretation, review
of relevant literature, preparation of project reports and
manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed journals,
presentation at professional conferences.
Minimum qualications: PhD in genetics, population
biology, evolution, genome science, data science, or an-
other relevant eld.
Preferred qualications: Preference will be given to ap-
plicants with 1) expertise in population genomics and
computational biology; 2) strong communication and
organizational skills; 3) can code in R and python and
have an interest in transparent and reproducible science;
and 4) strong publication records, or the potential for
developing one. Our team believes in and values the
power of diversity; candidates from groups that have his-
torically been underrepresented in science are strongly
encouraged to apply.
Salary: Commensurate with qualications and experi-
ence.
Application: Interested candidates should submit:
a one-page cover letter, your CV, and names and contact
information of at least three references familiar with
your work.
Please submit materials to Andrew Whitehead (awhite-
head@ucdavis.edu) with \Popgen Postdoc" in the sub-

UCopenhagen WeedEvollution
Postdoc in Weed Evolution and Population Genomics
Department of Plant and Environmental Sci-
ences,Faculty of Science, University of Copenhagen,
Denmark.
Description of the scientic environment
The Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences
conducts fundamental research and has a strong focus
on applying basic science to solve real world challenges,
primarily within the plant, soil and environmental sci-
ences. Research and teaching cover natural resources,
agriculture, biotechnology and synthetic biology from
the molecular to landscape scales.
The weed ecology and evolution group investigates the
eco-evolutionary processes that dictate the adaptation
and persistence of weedy and invasive plants in agroe-
cosystems. We have a gene to landscape focus using
approaches from population and evolutionary genet-
ics, evolutionary biology, plant ecology, modelling and
epidemiology and crop science. Our basic research recog-
nises that weedy plants are excellent models for studying
rapid plant adaptation. We apply these insights to de-
velop sustainable weed management strategies using
eco-evolutionary principles.
Project description
The position is funded by a Novo Nordisk Foundation
start package \Basic research on ecology, evolution and
sustainable management of weedy plants in agroecosys-
tems"awarded to Professor Paul Neve. The post holder
will work closely with another postdoc (plant/weed ecol-
ogy) and a PhD student (plant/weed evolutionary ecol-
ogy) in the weed ecology and evolution group.
You will address the questions 'what is the ecological
and genetic (genomic) basis of weediness inAlopecurus
myosuroides' and 'why has the species rapidly emerged
as a weed in some agroecosystems and not others?' You
will have access to a large collection of blackgrass ac-
cessions from around the world, including areas wherethe species is non-native and weedy, native but not a
major weed and non-native and non-weedy. We have
also recently completed the assembly and annotation of
a high-quality reference genome for blackgrass. Classi-
cal plant ecological approaches will establish phenotypic
and trait variation for common weedy traits within and
amongst these accessions (via your interaction with a
PhD studentship). As a molecular population biologist,
you will use population genomics type approaches to
address the genetic basis of the rapid evolution of weed-
iness. Approaches used could encompass (i) genomic
scans to identify areas of the genome under selection,
(ii) studies of variation in genome size/structure and
variation in large gene families implicated in resistance
to herbicides and adaptations to biotic and abiotic stress
and (iii) mapping and GWAS type approaches to explore
the genomic basis of identied weedy trait variation.
The postholder will work closely with collabora-
tors in the International Weed Genomics Consor-
tium at Colorado State University, USA (https://-
www.weedgenomics.org), and with other labs with exper-
tise in plant evolutionary genomics. Funds are available
for lab visits to build and enable these collaborations.

Base Stipend: $70,000.00 USD Travel Allotment:
$4,000.00 USD Full Description: Advances in next gen-
eration sequencing and bioinformatics have resulted in
major developments in the eld of infectious disease
research and genomic surveillance. With the COVID-19
pandemic, for instance, genomic surveillance has increas-
ingly been used by public health for contact tracing, for
determination of virus origins and points of introduc-
tions, identication of potential drivers of the evolution-
ary dynamics, and for surveillance of virus evolution
and important mutations that may result in change of
virus phenotype. This position will involve research
and development of methods for genomic surveillance
and virus evolution, including respiratory and FVBI
human pathogens of DoD importance. In addition to
population-level studies, intra-host pathogen evolution
and diversity will be studied, for analyses of transmis-
sion, resistance, host adaptation, disease severity and
general within-host pathogen evolution, and its corre-
lates to immune responses, infection, therapy response
and pathogen spread. This opportunity will involve
computational analyses of virus and patient data, as
well as development of new methods and tools for fur-
ther advancement of the eld. Familiarity with next
generation sequencing technology, advanced bioinfor-
matics tools (including prociency in R and python),
and experience with phylogenetic and phylodynamic
modelling is signicantly desired.

in-person position, for laboratory research to take place
on site in New Haven, Connecticut, USA. The initial
appointment is for one year, renewable upon review.
The start date is exible. Salary is negotiable, but
will be based on experience. There is no rm deadline:
Interviews will continue until the position is lled.
RESEARCH KEYWORDS: molecular genetics, molec-
ular microbiology, evolutionary biology, infectious dis-
eases, biochemistry, bioengineering
SCIENTIFIC DESCRIPTION: Study systems may in-
clude (but are not limited to): proteins, bacteria, bacte-
riophage, and potentially other systems (e.g. eukaryotic
viruses, yeast, tissue culture).
The ideal candidate would have experience with a range
of molecular and microbiological techniques, and famil-
iarity with sequencing and analysis methods. Experi-
mental biochemistry, proteomics, and transcriptomics
are additional areas of interest, as is tissue culture.
Comfort with computational platforms is strongly en-
couraged, and extra uency with these tools would be
a very strong bonus.
While I am recruiting with several concrete skill sets
and projects in mind, I would hire a bright, well-trained,

Online training - Generalised Linear Models as a unied
framework for data analysis in R
Dates: 6-10 September 2021
Course website: ( https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/glm-in-r/ )98 EvolDir August 1, 2021
In this course, we will introduce Generalised Linear
Models as a unied, coherent, and easily extendable
framework for the analysis of many dierent types of
data, including Normal (Gaussian), binary, and discrete
(count) responses, and both categorical (factors) and
continuous predictors.
The course is aimed at at graduate students and re-
searchers with little statistical knowledge but willing to
learn how to extract knowledge from data using statis-
tical models, how to use statistical models to increase
our understanding and make predictions about natural
phenomena, and acquiring a toolbox to analyse many
dierent types of data (beyond the typical Gaussian
responses) using R.
Learning outcomes
Being able to t, understand, and use statistical models
to make predictions and extract knowledge from data
Learn how to analyse data with dierent statistical dis-
tributions, estimating the eects of both categorical
(factors) and continuous predictors
Visualise data and tted models to check assumptions,
communicate results, and increase understanding
Practise R programming, particularly applied to data
visualisation and analysis (statistical modelling)
Acquire the statistical knowledge required to move on
to more complex models (e.g. Generalised Linear Mixed
Models, Generalised Additive Models, Bayesian mod-
elling) in the future.

Online GWAS Jun21-25
Dear all,
registrations are now open for the 3rd edition of the
Physalia course \Introduction to genome-wide associa-
tion studies (GWAS)" which will be delivered remotely
in June (21st-25th)Limited number of seats available
( https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
gwas-2/ )
Instructors: 1) Dr. Filippo Biscarini (CNR, Italy); 2) Dr.
Oscar Gonz alez-Recio (INIA, Spain); 3) Dr. Christian
Werner (University of Edinburgh, UK)
OVERVIEW
This course will introduce students, researchers and
professionals to the steps needed to build an analysis
pipeline for Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS).
The course will describe all the necessary steps in-
volved in a typical GWAS study, which will then be
used to build a reusable and reproducible bioinformatics
pipeline.
FORMAT
The course is structured in modules over ve days. Each
day will include introductory lectures with class discus-
sions of key concepts. The remainder of each day will
consist of practical hands-on sessions. These sessions
will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises
with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as
applying these skills on your own to complete individual
exercises. After and during each exercise, results will
be interpreted and discussed in group.
TARGETED AUDIENCE & ASSUMED BACK-
GROUND
The course is aimed at students, researchers and profes-
sionals interested in learning the dierent steps involved
in a GWAS study using them to build a structured
pipeline for semi-automated and reproducibile GWAS
analyses. It will include information useful for both
beginners and more advanced users. We will start by
introducing general concepts of GWAS and bioinfor-
matics pipeline building, progressively describing all
steps and putting there seamlessy together in a general
workow. Attendees should have a background in biol-
ogy, specically genetics; previous exposure to GWAS
experiments would also be benecial. There will be a
mix of lectures and hands-on practical exercises using
R, Linux command line and custom software. Some
basic understanding of R programming and Unix will be
advantageous. Attendees should also have some basic
familiarity with genomic data such as those arising from
NGS experiments.

Online IntroToFloraOfAlaska
Jun14-Jul14
Dear all,
Are you interested in learning about the Flora of Alaska
as well as getting familiar with some unique approaches
to delivering a systematic botany course online, this
might be the one for you. One of the hallmarks of
systematic botany courses is the hands-on learning ex-
perience in a laboratory setting. To create a similar
lab experience for the online oering, we have care-
fully chosen technology that will allow students from
all over the state (and even outside Alaska) to collect
data in their home communities, perform plant dissec-
tions and have a hands-on learning experience within
the ora's native environment. Instead of traditional
course materials like textbooks, students will purchase
an inexpensive wide-angle macro lens that connects to
their smartphone or tablet. This 2-inch lens lets stu-
dents take high-resolution, detailed photos of ora on
the go with classifying metadata, such as GPS location
attached. The technology not only lets students mimic
lab spaces in their own natural areas but also expands
their digital networks through the submission of images
to iNaturalist, enabling them to share and collaborate
with enthusiasts around the world and contribute citizen
science data to research. Students don't just sit at their
computers in this class, they go outside, touch with their
hands and share what they discover. The course design
includes carefully videotaped lectures using the Learn-
ing Glass platform, video dissection demonstrations,
virtual biome exploration using a 360 $B!k(B camera,
and selected interactive reading materials. This course
is an exciting intersection of curiosity for wild plants,
an exploration of Alaska's plant communities and an
accessible introduction to the science of botany.
Class URL: https://introtoora.community.uaf.edu/
Where: University of Alaska Fairbanks (USA)
Instructor: Dr. Ste Ickert-Bond (Professor of Botany
and Curator of the Herbarium (ALA) at the Universityof Alaska Fairbanks)
Course goals:
The objective of this class is to introduce you to sev-
eral aspects of Alaska's unique ora. Class modules
and hands-on exercises are designed to familiarize you
with the identication, description, and morphology of
our local ora. In addition, you will get familiar with
dissection of owers, using technical keys, seeing sci-
entic (Latinized) names, and learn vocabulary that
comes with describing and talking about plants, and
curate images that you will take of the plants in your
immediate surroundings.
Student learning outcomes:
On completion of this class, you will be able to identify
and describe several common plant families and species
that are native and common to Interior Alaska and
be more comfortable with oral dissection and taking
photographs of owering plants that will aid in their
identication and classication.
Dates: The 2-credit class will run from 14 June- 14 July
and is fully asynchronous.
Registration: You can register at https://-
ecampus.uaf.edu/register/ and select 51595 BIOLF195.
The class costs $468. eCampus courses charge in-state

metric measurement, geometric morphometric datasets,
life history traits, gene expression data, etc.) on phylo-
genetic trees [ with either fossil species, extant species
or both] as well as statistical tools such as multivari-
ate generalized least squares (GLS) linear models -e.g.
multivariate regression, MANOVA, MANCOVA - for
studying comparative datasets.
In this course, students will be rst introduced to some
theory with illustrative examples (both from simulated
data as well as students' own datasets) and will learn
how to interpret the models, their parameters, as well
as how to assess their reliability.

Online RNAseqBioconductor
Nov1-12
Dear all,
registrations are now open for the 3rd edition
of the Physalia course \RNA-seq data analysis in
R/Bioconductor": ( https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/course19/ )
ONLINE - November 01-12, 2021August 1, 2021 EvolDir 101
Overview
This course will provide biologists and bioinformaticians
with practical statistical analysis skills to perform rig-
orous analysis of high-throughput genomic data. The
course assumes basic familiarity with genomics and with
R programming, but does not assume prior statistical
training. It covers the statistical concepts necessary to
analyze genomic and transcriptomic high-throughput
data generated by next-generation sequencing, including:
hypothesis testing, data visualization, genomic region
analysis, dierential expression analysis, and gene set
analysis.

Online SeascapeGenomics Oct18-22
Dear all,
registrations are now open for the Physalia course on
\Seascape Genomics", which will take place ONLINE
from the 18th to the 22nd of October.
Instructors:
Dr. Laura Benestan (CEFE-CNRS, FR) and Dr. Oliver
Selmoni (EPFL, CH).
Course website: ( https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/course70/ )
In this course, students will rstly learn how to extract
environmental data from publicly available databases
and how to use it to characterize the seascape struc-
ture and conditions. For instance, students will learn
how to use remote sensing data to describe sea water
temperature oscillations or sea water movements. Next,
the course will bring its focus on genomic analyses: stu-
dents will learn how to evaluate genetic structures in the
marine environment and how to calculate and display
connectivity between populations. The combination
of environmental and genomic data will also lead to
the study of local adaptation. Students will learn dif-
ferent methods to discover genetic/genomic signatures
potentially involved in adaptation against specic envi-
ronmental constraints. The course will also cover the
critical task of the interpretation and validation of the
results, particularly in an applied conservation and man-
agement context. Finally, the workshop will consider
the crucial aspects and good habits to account for de-
signing a seascape genomics experiment (e.g. sampling
design) from a relevant scientic question.

Online Stdpopsim Jun14-17
Stdpopsim is a community-maintained library of stan-
dard population genetic simulation models. Stdpopsim
is designed to make it easier for researchers to run
reproducible, bug-free simulations of genetic datasets
from published demographic histories. Under the hood,
stdpopsim relies on msprime and SLiM 3 to generate
sample datasets in the tree sequence format.
If you are interested in using stdpopsim, but daunted by
the command line and Python, we are hosting an open,
online workshop in June that will cover both computing
skills and using the stdpopsim library for simulating
genetic datasets. Topics covered include using Unix
Shell, Python, Git, and stdpopsim library. No prior
familiarity with this material is required to participate
in the workshop.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.August 1, 2021 EvolDir 105
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
