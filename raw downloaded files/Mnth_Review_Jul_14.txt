Event information
Birds are adapted to a diverse range of habitats, and
operate within a broad range of dietary niches. This di-
versity of life histories has resulted in an equally varied
suite of adaptations for acquiring mates, nding food,
avoiding predators and for navigation. In this meet-
ing, a distinguished list of international researchers en-
compassing avian vision, taste, olfaction, geo-magnetic
sense, nociception (pain), tactile sense, and emotion,
will be brought together to discuss new and emerg-
ing evidence of the evolution, development, mechanisms
and function of avian senses.
This meeting is free to attend but participants must
request an invitation before they can register.

RBG Edinburgh PlantEvolution
Sep8-9
The United Kingdom is home to exceptional evolution-
arybiologists. However, compared to the number of
evolutionaryzoologists, the number of their botanical
counterparts is few. In many cases, U.K. plant evo-
lutionary biologists are in small numbers at any one
institution, and such isolation hinders progress.
The Royal Botanic Gardens, Edinburgh will host a con-
ference on 8, 9 September, 2014 to help address this
situation. The conference will showcase evolutionary
research on plants by UK researchers to foster new col-
laborations. The conference will also hold a workshop,
where discussion will identify challenges faced and sug-
gest strategies to overcome them. We see this as a
rst step towards developing a longer-terms strategy for
strengthening the UK community of plant evolutionary
biologists.
The conference will include a poster and networking
session, open speaking slots (both standard and \light-
ning" talks), as well as an exciting lineup of invited
speakers.

SanDiego PhysiologicalAdaptation
Oct5-8
The upcoming Intersociety Meeting in Comparative
and Evolutionary Physiology, organized by the Amer-
ican Physiological Society and several sponsoring soci-
eties (Society for Experimental Biology, SICB, TCS)
will be held in San Diego, CA, October 5-8, 2014.
The Meeting Website is available at: http://www.the-
aps.org/mm/Conferences/APS-Conferences/2014-
Conferences/Comparative Funds are available to
support student and postdoc travel. Several Special
Symposia will cover a variety of topics regarding
physiological adaptation.
Abstract submissions are due July 9, 2014.
In particular, Professor Guy Charmantier from Univer-
sit e Montpellier, France has organized a special sym-
posium on Physiological Adaptation from Marine to
Freshwater Environments. Invited speakers are listed
below. Abstract submissions are encouraged to be in-
cluded in this session:
Invasions of freshwater habitats by marine and brack-
ish organisms have been successfully performed by only
a few animal taxa over evolutionary time, and consti-
tute one of the major transitions in the history of life.
In addition, recent and rapid colonizations of fresh-
water areas have resulted from human activities, such
as transportation. Invading low salinity environments
confronts the animals with serious challenges for main-
taining hydromineral balance, mainly in retaining and
acquiring ions against adverse gradients, and excret-
ing excess water. Freshwater environments can also be
aected by contaminations, either natural or anthro-
pogenic. As natural selection acts on all developmental
stages, each must adapt to new conditions before in-
vasion of a novel environment, such as freshwater, can
become successful. This symposium addresses various
physiological adaptations that have enabled coloniza-July 1, 2014 EvolDir 7
tions of fresh water from marine environments over dif-
ferent time scales. Speakers will describe physiological
adaptations at multiple hierarchical levels of biological
organization, from molecules to organisms and popu-
lations, and will discuss several model species or taxa,
mainly crustaceans and sh, at dierent stages of devel-
opment, from embryos to adults. The talks will explore
adaptive responses to challenges imposed by freshwater
environments, including the presence of contaminants.

EvolutionaryBiology
At the Faculty of Engineering and Science, Department
of Biotechnology, Chemistry and Environmental Engi-
neering, Section of Biology and Environmental Science
a PhD stipend is available within the general study pro-
gramme Biotechnology. The stipend is open for ap-
pointment from 1 September 2014. Job description
The interplay between the genotype and the environ-
ment governs the phenotype and ultimately the suc-
cess of populations and species. The aim of the PhD
study is to increase our understanding of interactions
between the genotype and the environment. Popula-
tions of Drosophila and other arthropod model organ-
isms will be investigated under a range of ecologically
relevant benign and stressful environmental conditions
and their functional and molecular phenotypes, as well
genotypes, will be assessed to pinpoint causes and con-
sequences of genotype by environment interactions. A
special case of genotype by environment interactions,
namely interactions between inbreeding and the envi-
ronment, in small populations with high rates of in-
breeding and genetic drift may have special focus in the
proposed project. Results are expected to deepen our
understanding of complex associations between geno-
types and environments and thus provide answers to
pressing questions in conservation and evolutionary bi-
ology.
The PhD project is part of a larger project nanced
trhough a Sapere Aude grant from the Danish Research
Council. Applicants for this PhD position should hold
a Master's Degree (or equivalent) in Biology, Biotech-
nology or similar, and have a strong interest in exper-
imental as well as analytical work. Excellent skills in
oral and written English are required. The candidate
must submit the application including CV, list of pub-
lications (if available), ocial examination certicates
and one or more recommendation letters.
You may obtain further information from Professor
MSO Torsten Nygaard Kristensen, phone: (+45) 6146

AMU Poznan MHCEvolutionGuppy
Graduate position: AMU Poznan.MHCEvolutionGuppy
PhD position in evolutionary biology is available for
four years starting from 1st October 2014 in a project
\Testing new MHC allele advantage in semi-natural
populations of the guppy, Poecillia reticulata". This
collaborative project is led by Professor Jacek Radwan
(Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan), Dr Cock van
Oosterhout (University of East Anglia) and Dr Joanne
Cable (Cardi University, School of Biosciences), and
is funded by Polish Science Centre (NCN).
Genes of the Major Histocompatibility Complex
(MHC), involved in parasite recognition, are crucial for
the adaptive immune response in vertebrates. While
theories explaining maintenance of MHC polymorphism
have been proposed decades ago, empirical tests of some
of the most inuential hypotheses are scant. Most no-
tably, predictions about frequency-dependent selection
(i.e. the hypothesis that rare MHC alleles should be
selected for because fast-evolving parasites will adapt
to evade immune recognition by common MHC alle-
les) have not been rigorously tested. The aim of this
project is to test crucial predictions of this hypothesis
using semi-natural populations of the guppy, Poecilia
reticulata. The project will be based on Tobago and
will use mesocosm setups to trace frequencies of MHC
alleles, and infection levels associated with them, over
several generations.July 1, 2014 EvolDir 11
The PhD student will be mostly responsible for molec-
ular analyses, but help in running the eld experiment
at Tobago is also possible.
The candidate should hold MSc degree in biological sci-
ences. Applicants should provide the following docu-
ments:
1) Application letter 2) Copy of MSc diploma 3) CV
4) Motivation letter including description of scientic
interests 5) Information on scientic activities of the
candidate, including list of publications, active confer-
ence participation, work in scientic societies, honors

BACKGROUND - The understanding of genetic vari-
ation is essential to decode traces that evolution has
left in our genomes and whole-genome sequence data
now allow us to do interpret these signals at a res-
olution never possible before. Adaptive processes in
humans have left signature in the genome and infor-
mation about sites putatively under positive selection
in human is now available.Next challenge is to com-
bine this information with functional interpretation to
understand the environmental pressure that drove the
adaptation and the underlying molecular mechanisms
at cellular level.
RESEARCH PROJECT - This project aims to study
functional consequences of a mutation in a gene show-
ing evidences for positive selection in Asians and Eu-
ropeans. This gene is implicated in the formation of
the skin lipid barrier and regulated by UV radiation.
Alterations of the gene sequence cause severe forms of
skin diseases. This project will clarify key molecular12 EvolDir July 1, 2014
mechanisms of interaction of humans with the environ-
ment and advance our understanding of the role of en-
vironmental adaptation in modern diseases. Project
includes both wet laboratory experiments (40% ) and
bioinformatics analyses (60%) and a mandatory work
experience abroad.
ELIGIBILITY - Candidates with a master de-
gree either in biology/medicine or informat-
ics/mathematics/physics/engineer are equally eligible
and in each case they should be willing to do both wet
laboratory and computational analyses.
SELECTION CRITERIA - The successful applicant
will be selected on documented theoretical and experi-
mental knowledge relevant for the area of study, knowl-
edge of scientic theory and method, analytical skills,
personal motivation and team working skills. Well-
developed English language skills are required. The

MarinePopulationGenetics
topic : URGENT PhD in Marseilles-France, marine
population genetics/metabarcoding
We seek a highly motivated and well ranked PhD stu-
dent to study the biodiversity of (marine) coralligenous
habitats, at both the community and intraspecic lev-
els, from data that will be mostly obtained using genetic
tools including Next-Generation Sequencing, and ana-
lyzed taking into account ecological factors and marine
currents (at both the local and Mediterranean scales).
The scientic interest relies in comparing diversity at
the community level, assessed by metabarcoding and
compared with traditional taxonomical methods, and
diversity at the intraspecic level (population genetics
or genomics), providing ways of testing hypotheses such
as the neutral biodiversity one, for instance. The im-
plicated goalis to gain knowledge on these habitats,
which provide important services and are very species
rich, in order to propose new, ecient and cost-eectiveindicators of their ecological status, based on intra-
specic and/or inter-specic diversity (to be tested).
The team working on this topic, nanced by two Eu-
ropean projects is locally composed of a post-doctoral
fellow (starting in autumn 2014), a PhD student on
coralligenous Socio-ecosystem (starting autumn 2014)
and an engineer to help with meta-barcoding (to be
hired before the end of 2014), a last-year PhD student
(diving, ecology, indicators), and several permanent re-
searchers plus the diving team.

BeetleGenomics
*Master Thesis Projects in Max Planck Institute for
Chemical Ecology - Research Group Insect Symbiosis *
A position is available from July 2014 in Jena, Ger-
many, to carry out either of the projects outlined be-
low.
Beetles in the subfamily Lagriinae live in association to
bacteria of the genus /Burkholderia/, a group exhibit-
ing extraordinary ecological and metabolic versatility.
The transmission of the symbiotic bacteria from mother
to ospring is facilitated by structures, particularly in
the larval stage, that are considered unique in terms of
location and development.
*Project 1: Horizontal transmission of bacterial sym-
bionts in lagriid beetles*
Despite a described vertical transmission route, the pos-
sibility remains that lagriid beetles occasionally acquire
/Burkholderia/ from the environment or from related
host species (horizontal transmission), having impor-
tant implications for the ecology and evolutionary tra-
jectory of the association. The main purpose of the
project is to test whether horizontal transmission ofbacterial symbionts can occur across two dierent la-
griid species and to describe potential exchange routes,
as well as the possibility of infection by multiple bacte-
rial strains.
In order to address these questions, the student will
work on manipulative experiments involving bacterial
culture, insect collection and lab rearing, DNA extrac-
tion, PCR, phylogenetic analyses and Fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH). We are looking for a highly
motivated candidate with a strong background in the
areas of ecology, evolutionary biology, entomology or
microbiology, to carry out her/his M.Sc. thesis project
or an internship for a period of 4-6 months.
*Project 2: Genomics of /Burkholderia/ symbionts of
lagriid beetles *
The symbiotic bacteria in the two lagriid hosts inves-
tigated until now belong to the species /Burkholde-
ria gladioli/, which is known to be pathogenic on cer-
tain plants and fungi, as well as an opportunistic hu-
man pathogen. The lagriid-associated strains possess a
genome of comparable size lacking evident signs of gene
erosion, contrary to other vertically transmitted bacte-
rial symbionts. A M.Sc. thesis project is available to
carry out a comparative genomic analysis of the sym-
biotic strains and closest relatives with a dierent life
style in order to identify genomic traits and/or specic
genes that are potentially relevant for the symbiosis.
The M.Sc. student should have experience and/or a
solid theoretical knowledge in bioinformatics, genome
analysis and biochemistry, as well as a strong interest
in evolutionary biology and the ecology of symbiotic
interactions. Background in transcriptome analyses is
also advantageous.

EukaryoticPhylogenomics
A PhD position on eukaryotic phylogenomics is avail-
able at the University Paris-Sud (France) in the
DEEM laboratory (Diversity, Ecology and Evolu-
tion of Microorganisms: http://www.ese.u-psud.fr/-
spip.php?rubrique7&lang=en).
-Scientic context: Despite intense research in recent
years, the general phylogeny of eukaryotes remains
poorly resolved. The order of divergence of the ma-
jor eukaryotic phyla and the settlement of essential
metabolic and structural features are still insuciently
described. Many extant eukaryotic phyla emerged
through the gain or loss of plastids carrying out photo-
synthesis. Plastid endosymbiosis is accompanied by a
massive ow of Endosymbiotic Gene Transfers (EGT)
from the symbiont to the host genome. The rst plastid
endosymbiosis in eukaryotes involved a cyanobacterium
and an unknown host and gave rise to the supergroup
Archaeplastida (green algae and plants, red algae, and
glaucophytes). This initial endosymbiosis was followed
by a number of subsequent endosymbioses where var-
ious heterotrophic hosts engulfed and converted green
and red algae into the secondary plastids found in many
eukaryotic phyla today. These, and their heterotrophic
relatives, were shaped by secondary endosymbiosis but
we still do not know when, how and to what extent.
-Project: The goal of the PhD project is to decipher
the role of secondary endosymbiosis in eukaryotic evo-
lution by improving the genome sequence data for un-
derrepresented phyla and providing a rigorous analysis
of EGT traces in these genomes. Using next generation
sequencing, we are producing high coverage transcrip-
tomes of a variety of photosynthetic and heterotrophic
species having strategic positions on the phylogeny of
eukaryotes. The PhD will be in charge of analyzing
these data by phylogenomic and comparative genomic
methods to: 1) Enhance the resolution of the tree of
eukaryotes, 2) detect traces of secondary endosymbio-
sis and attempt to infer when they occurred, 3) take
advantage of this new genomic resources to understand
the evolution and the settlement of original metabolic
features characteristic of these eukaryotic groups.
-Qualications: Candidates must have an MSc degree
and strong interest in early evolution and eukaryotic
diversity and phylogeny as well as some experience incomputational biology.
-Application: The application should include 1) a mo-
tivation letter, 2) a detailed CV with grades/ranks, and
3) the names and contact information for at least two
referees. This material has to be sent by e-mail to
David Moreira (david.moreira@u-psud.fr) and Philippe

UGlasgow Adaptation
PhD Studentship, University of Glasgow
Food security in the omics era: the role of polyploidy,
hybridisation and mating system on the ability of crops
to adapt to changing environments
An acknowledged threat to food security is the ability of
crops and livestock to respond to increased environmen-
tal variability resulting from climate change. In plants,
crops are often selected to be able to self-propagate
but this comes at a cost to genetic variation, which
could reduce potential for adaptation to changing en-
vironments. Hybridising dierent strains can increase
genetic variation and combine desirable traits from dif-
ferent species but this is often accompanied by doubling
of the genome (polyploidisation) to increase stability of
the hybrid combination. Theoretically, this should in-
crease exibility to adapt to changing conditions. How-
ever, the relative eects of such breeding strategies on
adaptability and the consequences for yield of econom-
ically important traits remain largely untested. Impor-
tantly, plants adapting to changing environments need
to be able to continue to attract benecial symbionts
(pollinators and soil microbes that enable them to pro-
cess nutrients) and to combat potentially new threats
(pathogens and herbivores) but it is not known how the
combination of mating system, ploidy and hybridisation
aect such interactions. An exciting technological de-
velopment is characterisation of microbial communities
using deep sequencing approaches. The vast amounts
of data generated and the diculty of resolving species
based on short sequences means that improved meth-
ods need to be developed for characterising microbial
diversity and interpreting what this means for interact-
ing organisms.July 1, 2014 EvolDir 19
Using a common garden approach, combined with gen-
eration and analysis of deep sequencing data, and devel-
opment of advanced statistical approaches to character-
ising biodiversity, the purpose of this multidisciplinary
project is to use economically important Brassica na-
pus (oilseed rape, which is used for both biofuel and
edible oil production and is a polyploid hybrid that re-
produces by self-fertilising) as a model to investigate:
1) the relative ability of plants with dierent traits to
adapt to new environments; 2) the role of the microbial
community in plant adaptation; 3) the consequences
of the interaction between plant tness and microbial
community diversity for oil seed yield.

UGlasgow VirusEvolution
A genomic approach to uncovering the mechanismsdriving host restriction and virulence in louping ill virus
Why particular viruses are able to infect and to cause
disease in some host species but not others are funda-
mental questions that are critical for controlling viral
pathogens. This project aims to uncocver the molec-
ular and evolutionary mechanisms underlying host re-
striction and virulence of louping-ill virus (LIV), one
of several closely related tick-borne aviviruses in Eu-
rope that exhibit high phenotyopic variability: whereas
LIV mainly causes disease in British sheep and grouse,
other LIV strains and related viruses elsewhere in Eu-
rope tend to aect other livestock species or human
hosts. Using a combination of whole genome sequenc-
ing, bioinformatics, in vitro experiments and reverse
genetics the project aims to 1) examine the genome-
wide diversity and evolutionary history of LIV across
its current range; 2) compare the ability of dierent
LIV strains and related virus species for in vitro growth
in a range of host species; 3) to experimentally ver-
ify putative genotype-phenotype relationships through
a reverse genetics system. Through the application of
powerful new technologies and analytic approaches, the
project will provide novel insights about the biology of a
signicant animal pathogen in the UK and advance our
general understanding of the factors governing virus-

A 4-year PhD position at University of Helsinki in res-
urrection ecology:
Reconstructing past responses of Eubosmina maritima
to anthropogenic environmental changes using the his-
torical archives of the Baltic Sea sediment
A powerful way to reconstruct past responses of popu-
lations to human-induced environmental changes is to
use the information hidden in the sediment in the form
of dormant eggs and subfossils. We investigate how
and why the cladoceran zooplankton community has
changed in response to human-induced environmental
change during the last century, using resurrection ecol-
ogy, paleolimnology and paleogenomics.
The PhD project will involve reconstructing past re-
sponses of Eubosmina maritima to human-induced
changes of the Baltic Sea, particularly to eutrophica-
tion and changes in the sh fauna. Recorded pheno-
typic changes will be related to environmental changes
to determine whether the population has been able to
track changes in the environment. Reaction norm ex-
periments will be performed to investigate the degree of
plasticity and the limits of responses. The work will be
complemented with genomic work carried out within
the research group. This will allow us to determine
the genetic underpinning of the phenotypic changes. A
detailed research plans will be developed and tailored
to match your individual interests and strengths. The
work is done in collaboration with the research groups
of prof. Dieter Ebert at University of Basel and Dr
Luisa Orsini at University of Birmingham. English is
the working language.
*Your role: Your work will include the retrieval and
hatching of dormant eggs of E. maritima from dated
sediments of the Baltic Sea, the cultivation of clonal
lineages from these resurrected eggs, and the perfor-
mance of reaction norm experiments using the clonal
lineages, to determine their responses to blooms of toxic
cyanobacteria. In addition, microfossils will be mea-
sured to record phenotypic changes across time. De-
pending on your interests and strengths, you can con-
tribute to the genomic work. You will work in close
collaboration with two post-docs within the group, and
participate in the supervision of undergraduate stu-
dents and assistants.
*Qualications: You will have a Masters or equivalent
degree in ecology or evolutionary biology (or related
elds), and a strong interest in the research questionsJuly 1, 2014 EvolDir 21
and a high motivation to pursue a PhD. Excellent writ-
ten and oral communication skills in English are re-

GeneNetworkEvolutionaryBiol
Graduate position for a PhD in the evolutionary biol-
ogy of gene networks.
1.Job/ project description:
The main objectives of the PhD project is to:
a) Develop mathematical models of the relationship be-
tween genetic and phenotypic variation (or genotype-
phenotype map)
b) Understand how this relationship and the patterns
of phenotypic variation possible by genetic variation in
gene networks aect evolution.
c) Develop models about the evolution of gene networks
and embryonic development in general.
A core concept of current evolutionary biology is the
genotype-phenotype (GP) map, which connects genetic
variation to phenotypic variation and to potential for
evolutionary change. The aim of the project is to de-velop or investigate models of the GP map that can
be related to specic biological study systems or spe-
cic evolutionary questions investigated by the group.
There is considerable exibility as to the exact topics,
and the interests of the candidate will be important in
dening the study objects.
These models can be abstract or linked to specic bi-
ological systems. The biotechnology institute includes
a range of experimental biologitst working on several
systems. The supervisor of the theoretical aspects
will be Dr. Salazar-Ciudad but the PhD would in-
clude close collaboration with Jukka Jernvall group and
would include collaboration with developmental biolo-
gists, bioinformaticians, paleontologists and other evo-
lutionary and systems biologists. The work may also
include, optionally, collaboration, and spending some

\Evolution of ant slavery and the genetic basis of slave-
maker and host behavior"
We invite applications for a 3-years PhD position at
the JG University of Mainz, Germany. The project
aims at understanding the evolution of slavemaking and
host defense behavior and its genetic basis. Our model
system are /Temnothorax/ ants, in which ant slavery
evolved repeatedly and in which parasite pressure led
to the evolution of multiple host defense strategies. In
this project, we use a RNA-seq approach to study char-
acteristic gene expression patterns in closely related
slavemaker and host species and compare dierent be-
havioural states within and between species. Moreover,
we will use sequence data to detect dierentially se-
lected genes between slavemaker and host species withthe aim to identify genes involved in slavemaker and
host evolution. Our aim is to link slavemaker pheno-
type to its underlying genotype, as to unravel in future
the genetic basis of coevolution in these obligate social
parasite-host systems.
The position requires a Diploma or Master degree in
Biology (or a related eld). The successful candidate

BeetleGenomics
Graduate Opportunity (MSc) Spatial Genomic analysis
of North American Mountain Pine Beetle Outbreaks
We are recruiting an MSc student to investigate
the spatial genomic patterns among outbreak popu-
lations of mountain pine beetle across North Amer-
ica. This will involve collaborative work among a num-
ber of Canada Universities and Canadian Forest Ser-
vice conducted under funding to the TRIA project
(see www.thetriaproject.ca). The work will build upon
previous spatial genetic studies (e.g., Samarasekera
et al 2012; Janes et al 2014) by using a genotype-
by-sequencing approach to explore genomic dierences
among outbreak populations and to identify loci under
selection. Results of this study will improve our un-
derstanding of the genetic dierences among mountain
pine beetle outbreaks and provide needed information
for the management and predictive modeling of future
outbreaks.
The qualied student will conduct the majority of their
course work and research at the Prince George campus
of the University of Northern BC, but will also have
the opportunity to engage in courses and meetings in-
volving TRIA members from other Canadian Univer-
sities. UNBC is a small, but dynamic research inten-
sive university (www.unbc.ca). The Prince George area
oers abundant outdoor recreation activities. Please
see our website for more information on the Natural
Resources and Environmental Studies Graduate Pro-
gram including degree requirements and expectations
(www.unbc.ca/nres/).
Qualications: This is a challenging, but rewarding
project requiring a range of interests and aptitudes.
Preferably, the successful applicant will have a degree in
biology or ecology. Previous experience and coursework
in insect biology, population genetic and/or molecular
ecology are an asset. The student should be willing
to work in a collaborative environment with multiple
University and Government research partners.
Ideally the MSc will begin in Sept 2014, although later
start dates will be considered. We anticipate a compet-
itive stipend ( ~20,000/year) and full funding to support
lab and other research activities.

EvolutionAnimalPersonality
THE EVOLUTION OF INDIVIDUAL BE-
HAVIOURAL VARIATION
A great deal of research in recent years has revealed
that animals from a wide range of species display con-
sistent individual behaviours (known as animal person-
ality, behavioural types, temperament), and that this
individual variation can have powerful ecological con-
sequences. In this project the student will focus upon
unravelling some of the ecological factors important in
the evolution of animal personality, using the three-
spined stickleback as a model system.
Sticklebacks occupy a range of habitats which vary nat-
urally in their parasite abundance and diversity, preda-
tion regime, and resource availability. The project will
involve experimental lab-work, characterising individ-
ual sh for personality traits and parasite fauna, in-
fection experiments, and also eldwork to explore nat-
ural behavioural variation among and within popula-
tions in the adaptive radiation of sticklebacks on the
island of North Uist in the Scottish Outer Hebrides,
from which longitudinal data is available on parasite
abundance and diversity, predation risk, and resource
availability. Key questions include: how do parasites,
predation and resource availability interact to produce
patterns of individual behavioural variation in natural
populations? Do sh with dierent personality types
vary in their parasite load, and if so what is the mech-anism driving this? What are the tness outcomes of
personality types under divergent ecological conditions?
How does do cumented life-history variation, within-
and between-populations relate to behavioural varia-
tion?
Applicants should have a good degree in a relevant
subject, and a strong interest and enthusiasm for evo-
lutionary biology/ecology/animal behaviour. Previous
eldwork or experience working with animal behaviour
and/or sh parasites, and a full driving licence would
be benecial but are not essential. The project will be
co-supervised by Assoc. Prof. Andrew Maccoll.
Informal enquiries can be made to Ben Chapman:

UOslo AvianSpermEvolution
A 4 year PhD position is available at the Natural
history Museum (NHM), University of Oslo (http://-
www.nhm.uio.no).
The subject of the PhD project is \Evolution of sperm
form and function in passerine birds". Passerine birds,
and especially the oscine passerines or songbirds, are
highly diversied in sexual traits, including their sperm
cells. Recent research has documented that post-
copulatory sexual selection, mediated by female promis-
cuity (extrapair copulations), shape sperm phenotypes
and lead to longer and/or faster-swimming sperm over
evolutionary time scales. The project will examine
in more detail how particular sperm structures, espe-
cially the size and shape of the sperm head, which con-
tains the acrosome and the nucleus, vary in response to
sexual selection across the passerine phylogeny. TheJuly 1, 2014 EvolDir 25
project will also study how variation in sperm phe-
notypes among males in a population is inuenced by
current selection pressures. NHM holds a large collec-
tion of passerine sperm samples, which will be the main
source material for analysis, using high-resolution light
and electron microscopy. There will also be some eld
work in Norway and abroad for collecting additional
sperm samples.
We seek a person with strong motivation and ability
to dene his/her own research questions. The candi-
date must have wide interests in evolution and ecology,
and should have good knowledge in avian systematics
and practical experience with ornithological eld work.
Candidates with experience in microscopy techniques of
biological material and relevant tools in molecular phy-
logenetics and comparative methods will be preferred.
Applicants must hold a Master's degree or equivalent
in evolutionary biology.
The position is aliated with the Sex and Evo-
lution Research Group (SERG) at NHM (https://-

UOslo EvolutionaryGenomics
Doctoral Research Fellowship in Evolutionary Ge-
nomics/Behavioural Ecology
A 4-year PhD position is available at the Natural His-
tory Museum (NHM), University of Oslo (UiO). The
PhD project is part of a larger research program on
'Sperm-pathogen interactions and the evolution of ejac-
ulate antimicrobial defences in passerine birds'.
Animals are constantly exposed to pathogens, and the
ability of individuals to combat microbial attack is an
important component of tness. Sperm cells are not
immune to microbial exposure, and bacteria can cause
reductions in sperm quality and compromise male fertil-
ity. Moreover, ejaculate-borne pathogens can be trans-ferred during mating (i.e. STDs), with negative conse-
quences for female fertility. Thus, ejaculate-borne bac-
teria are predicted to generate intense selection for the
evolution of antibacterial substances in seminal uid.
This project integrates organismal and molecular ap-
proaches to develop an understanding of the role of bac-
teria in the evolution of avian seminal uid and factors
that minimise bacterial-induced sperm defects and limit
the transmission of STDs. The successful candidate will
be allowed to focus on either the evolutionary genomics
or the behavioural ecology aspects of the larger study
(or some combination of these two) as best ts her/his
skills and research interests. She/he will also be encour-
aged to develop additional, complementary avenues of
research.
Interested candidates should have a good degree in a
relevant subject, such as background in evolutionary bi-
ology or behavioural ecology. In addition, an interest in
evolutionary genomics and previous eldwork and bird
handling experience would be advantageous. The posi-
tion is aliated with the Sex and Evolution Research
Group (SERG) at the Natural History Museum (NHM)
and the Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Syn-
thesis (CEES), and may also include a period of time
based in the laboratory of Dr Steve Dorus (Syracuse

scientists from the USA and Germany. The working
language will be English. Fieldwork may be conducted
at a variety of locations, including Norway and Italy.

The subject of the PhD project is \Functional ge-
nomics of sperm phenotypes and cryptic female choice26 EvolDir July 1, 2014
in passerine birds". In many passerine bird species, fe-
males copulate frequently with extra-pair mates, which
implies that sperm from dierent males compete for the
same set of ova and that there might be sperm-female
interactions aecting the outcome of sperm competi-
tion. This project takes a molecular approach to deepen
our understanding of the possible mechanisms involved
in this form of sexual selection at the gamete level.
The project has two main goals, a) nding molecular
markers or genes associated with sperm performance
traits, b) test if females obtain good or compatible genes
through extrapair mating, in particular immune genes
at the Major Histocompatibility Complex. The project
will adopt next-generation sequencing approaches for
several analyses, and utilize a large sample of already-
collected DNA from families of a few intensively stud-
ied species (e.g. willow warblers, bluethroats and barn
swallows). There will be little or no eld work but ex-
tensive analysis of molecular data for this project.
We seek a person with strong motivation and ability to
dene his/her own research questions. The candidate
must have wide interests in molecular ecology/genetics
and evolutionary biology, and good practical, hands-on
experience with relevant DNA methods. Good comput-

** position open until lled, preferred starting date:
September 1st 2014 **
The focus of our research is understanding whether or
not the details of the genetic systems underlying pheno-
typic variation aect the process of adaptation and how
such details may be molded by evolutionary forces. We
are particularly interested in gene multifunctionality, or
pleiotropy, and study both the adaptive consequences
(constraints) and the evolution of gene pleiotropy. The
context of this project is broad and the details will be
worked out with the candidate. There is potential for
international collaborations.Possible topics are: - co-evolution of gene pleiotropy
and gene expression, - evolution of the genotype-
phenotype map of complex traits, - impact of genetic
constraints on the evolution of species' ranges under
shifting environments.
Required are a strong motivation to pursue a PhD in
evolutionary theory, a strong background in popula-
tion or quantitative genetics, and documented skills in
modelling. The project should mix computational and
mathematical approaches. Knowledge of a programing
language (esp. C/C++) is required. The lab devel-
ops and maintains Nemo, an individual-based simula-
tion platform (http://nemo2.sourceforge.net) that will
serve as the basic computational simulation tool for the
project.
General requirements are a Diploma/Master degree in
a relevant discipline. The ideal candidates will have
strong oral and written communication skills in En-
glish and the ability to work and share ideas in a col-
laborative environment. Knowledge of German is not
essential but may help with everyday life. The In-
stitute hosts two seminar series with high-caliber in-
ternational speakers and works in close collaboration
with scientists of the neighboring research institutions
(ETH, EAWAG, WSL, etc.) The PhD position is
within the Zurich Life Science Graduate School's pro-
gram in Evolutionary Biology (http://www.lifescience-

Research assistants needed
Cooperative breeding in subterranean Damaraland
mole-rats (Fukomys damarensis)
2 Positions for a minimum of 6 months (max 12 months)
starting in August 2014;
Field and laboratory researchers are needed to conduct
research on a completely subterranean, highly social40 EvolDir July 1, 2014
mole-rat. Our interest is individual variation in coop-
erative behaviour and the consequences for life-histories
and individual tness in the cooperatively breeding
Damaraland mole-rat (Fukomys damarensis). Our sec-
ond research objective is investigating the hormonal
mechanisms underlying cooperative behaviour and so-
cial dynamics in mole-rat groups. The study is initiated
by Prof. Tim Clutton-Brock, University of Cambridge.
Position 1
We launched a study of permanently marked,
wild mole-rats at the <http://www.kalahari-
meerkats.com/index.php?id=krr >Kuruman River
Reserve (Northern Cape, South Africa). The mole-rats
are trapped, marked and measurements such as blood
samples, urine samples and morphological measure-
ments are taken. Animals in their natural burrow
systems will be monitored by identity chips remote
sensing. About 50% of the time the research assistant
will be conducting eld research and the other half
of the work would be carrying out behavioural obser-
vations of captive mole-rats held in tunnel systems
at the research station and assisting in conducting
behavioural experiment in captive colonies.
Position 2
This position entails assisting in a study on hormonal
manipulations of subordinate and dominant mole-rats.
We are interested in the organisational and activational
eects of steroid hormones on social behaviour and the
development of juvenile mole rats. The research assis-
tant holding this position will be involved in all steps
of the experiments and will mainly work in the labo-
ratory with our captive mole-rats. The responsibilities
include behavioural observations, hormonal measures
(blood sampling, urine sampling) and hormonal ma-
nipulations (implants).
Applicants for both positions should be enthusiastic,
willing to work hard and keen to get involved in a re-
search project in the African bush. Research assistants
are expected to stay in the eld over night when trap-
ping mole-rats or work night time when observations re-
quire night shifts. Research assistants need to be physi-
cally t as capturing mole-rats requires a fair amount of
digging. Applicants must be holders of a driving license
(Position 1). A zoology related degree and/or previous
eld experience will be considered an asset.
The successful applicants will work in a small team of
5-6 persons working on mole-rats.
The research station is also the home of sev-
eral other projects studying meerkats (www.kalahari-
meerkats.com), pied babblers, forktailed drongos and
hornbills resulting in a stimulating scientic environ-ment. Around 20-30 research assistants are based at
the station year round. Research assistants will learn a
range of skills such as remote sensing of behaviour, en-
docrine sampling techniques, capture-mark-recapture
techniques, behavioural observations, data handling
and management.
Accommodation is provided, and research assistants are
paid a monthly allowance to cover their food. A contri-
bution to their travel costs can be provided at the end
of their stay.
Applications received until the 27th of June will receive
full consideration. Later applications may be consid-
ered.

elds such as comparative genomics and genome evolu-
tion.
BILS is now starting a genome assembly group at Upp-
sala University in the creative environment of the SciL-
ifeLab Uppsala node \The Hub" and closely related to
the already running BILS annotation platform. This
group will work in close collaboration with Swedish

UppsalaU
EvolGeneticsBioinformatician
Bioinformatics position
A bioinformatics position is available in the group ofJochen Wolf at the Evolutionary Biology Centre in Up-
psala, Sweden. The position is initially limited to 2-
years and after evaluation can be made permanent.
Background. We are a young, growing research group
that applies an integrative approach to study evolution-
ary processes in natural populations. Major research
themes include speciation and genome evolution. One
of the main question is to understand the evolutionary
processes and genetic mechanisms underlying species
divergence (e.g. Ellegren et al. 2012, Shafer et al. 2013,
Poelstra et al. in press). Using large-scale genetic ap-
proaches, as well as eld based experiments, we charac-
terize genomic divergence across populations and (sub-
)species and assess its relationship to functional phe-
notypic divergence. In addition, we engage in (macro-
evolutionary) comparative approaches to study evolu-
tion across larger timescales (e.g. Nabholz et al. 2013)
and sometimes get interested in methodology (Mugal
et al. 2014, Vijay et al. 2013). Empirical systems
currently include birds (swallows and corvids), marine
mammals (pinnipeds and killer whales) and the Euro-
pean hemiclonal Pelophylax water frog system.
The position. The successful applicant will be responsi-
ble for management of large transcriptome and genome
resequencing data sets and engage actively in ongoing
research projects. The applicant is familiar with ge-
netic databases and has experience in standard bioin-
formatic approaches using high throughput sequencing
data from Illumina, SOLID, IonTorrent and (increas-
ingly) single molecule sequencing. Common tasks in-
volve data management, genome assembly and anno-
tation of vertebrates (Birds ca. 1.2 Gb, marine mam-
mals: ca. 3Gb), multiple sequence alignments, map-
ping, genotyping, etc. Prociency in relevant program-
ming languages (UNIX, Perl, Python, etc.) is natu-
rally assumed. A background in population genomics
or comparative genomics is benecial.
The environment. The Evolutionary Biology Centre
(http://www.ebc.uu.se/) is one of the world's lead-
ing research institutions in evolutionary biology. It
is part of Uppsala University which has been ranked
rst place among all European Universities in the sub-
ject of biology (CHE European ranking) and bridges
a broad variety of disciplines. The scientic environ-
ment with numerous seminars, journal clubs and social
activities oer excellent possibilities for contacts and
collaborations. A graduate school currently directed by
Jochen Wolf provides a framework for courses and high-
prole seminars broadly reecting the group's research
interests (http://www.ebc.uu.se/education/postgrad/-
gradschool/Seminars). Our lab is part of the Depart-
ment of Evolutionary Biology (http://www.ebc.uu.se/-
Research/IEG/evbiol/), an active environment ad-46 EvolDir July 1, 2014
dressing fundamental evolutionary questions with a
wide range of dierent approaches. As a member of the
Science for Life Laboratory (http://www.scilifelab.se/-
) we make extensive use of high performance com-
puting resources (https://www.uppmax.uu.se/uppnex)
and extended bioinformatic infrastructure (http:/-
/www.scilifelab.se/platforms/bioinformatics/). We
also actively interact with research groups of the
nearby BioMedicalCentre (http://www.imbim.uu.se/-
Research). The lab is situated in the student town of
Uppsala, that oers rich opportunities in cultural and
outdoor activities. Sweden's capital Stockholm is less
than an hour's train ride away.
How to apply. Applicants with a suitable back-
ground with and without a PhD degree are en-
couraged to apply. Applications including a
CV, a statement of motivation and the con-
tact details of at least two references should
be sent to: http://www2.personalavd.uu.se/jobb/-

American Genetic Association Presents the Annual
Stephen J. O'Brien Award
The Council of the American Genetic Association has
granted the annual Stephen J. O'Brien Award for
best student-authored articles published in Journal
of Heredity's 2013 volume. The award honors Dr.
Stephen J. O'Brien, who served as Editor-In-Chief for
the Journal from 1987-2007.
An Award Committee made up of the current Editor-
In-Chief, Scott Baker, an Associate Editor, Jill Pecon-
Slattery, and a Council member, David Baum, evalu-
ated 15 eligible articles. Council voted to present this
year's award to two authors for their outstanding pa-
pers: Dr. Sara Hanson for her article, \Inventory andPhylogenetic Analysis of Meiotic Genes in Monogonont
Rotifers", Journal of Heredity 2013:104(3):357-370 (su-
pervisor, Dr. John Logsdon), and Dr. Alexander
Nater for his article \Marked Population Structure and
Recent Migration in the Critically Endangered Suma-
tran Orangutan (Pongo abelii)", Journal of Heredity
2013:104(1):2-13 (supervisor, Dr. Michael Kr utzen).
The Award Committee, in presenting their recommen-
dation to Council, had the following comments:
\The panel had a dicult time choosing a single top
paper, as the strongest candidates diered markedly
in subject and approaches. One article emphasizes ge-
nomics of rotifers, and the other the conservation genet-
ics of Sumatran orangutans. The rotifer paper was re-
freshingly dierent from approaches taken by the other
papers, examined an interesting evolutionary problem,
and featured impressive methodology, including 454
sequencing of 2 genomes and rtPCR experiments for
gene expression. The orangutan paper was nicely writ-50 EvolDir July 1, 2014
ten and included comprehensive molecular ecology data
across the full range of an endangered ape. It illus-
trated the insights possible by the integration of genetic
and behavioral data of critically endangered, long-lived
species."
The award includes a $1,500 prize to each author, as
well as up to $1,500 reimbursement to attend the AGA
Symposium, and a three-year AGA membership and
subscription to Journal of Heredity.
The complete announcement and both freely
available articles are available at http://-
jhered.oxfordjournals.org/content/105/4/583.full
We congratulate both emerging researchers on this
achievement.

AnnArbor Hackathon Sep15-19
Apply for the Tree-for-All: A hackathon to access
OpenTree's global phylogeny resources.
A global 'tree of life' will transform biological research
in a broad range of disciplines from ecology to bio-
engineering. To help facilitate that transformation, the
OpenTree <http://opentreeoife.org >project [1] now
provides online access to >4000 published phylogenies,
and a newly generated tree covering more than 2.5 mil-
lion species.
The next step is to build tools to enable the commu-
nity to use these resources. To meet this aim, OpenTree
<http://www.opentreeoife.org/ >, Arbor <http://-
www.arborworkows.com/ >[2] and NESCent's HIP <
http://www.evoio.org/wiki/HIP >working groups [3]
are staging a week-long hackathon September 15 to 19
at U. Michigan, Ann Arbor. Participants in this 'Tree-
for-all' will work in small teams to develop tools that
use OpenTree's web services to extract, annotate, or
add data in ways useful to the community. Teams also
may focus on testing, expanding and documenting the
web services.
How could a global phylogeny be useful in your research
or teaching? What other data from OpenTree would be
valuable? How could OpenTree web services be inte-
grated into familiar workows and analysis tools? How
could we add to the database of published trees, or en-
rich it with annotations?If you can imagine using these resources, and you have
the skills to work collaboratively to turn those ideas
into products (as a coder, or working side-by-side with
coders), we invite you to apply for the hackathon. The
full call for participation (http://bit.ly/1ioPPMc) pro-
vides instructions for how to apply, and how to share
your ideas with potential teammates (strongly encour-
aged prior to applying). Applications are due July 8th.
Travel support is provided. Women and underrepre-
sented minorities are especially encouraged to apply.
If you have questions, contact Karen Cranston
(karen.cranston@nescent.org, @kcranstn, Open-

logenetic analysis of metastatic colon cancer in humans
Thursday, June 5, 2014 10:00 AM PDT
Metastasis is the main cause of cancer morbidity and
mortality. Despite its clinical signicance, several fun-
damental questions about the metastatic process in hu-mans remain unsolved. Does metastasis occur early
or late in cancer progression? Do metastases emanate
directly from the primary tumor or give rise to each
other? How does heterogeneity in the primary tumor
relate to the genetic composition of secondary lesions?
Addressing these questions \ ideally by examining the
genetic makeup of tumor cells in distinct anatomic lo-
cations and reconstructing their evolutionary relation-
ships " is crucial to improving our understanding of
metastasis. I will give an overview of a simple PCR-
based assay that enables the tracing of tumor lineage in
patient tissue specimens. The methodology relies on so-
matic variation in highly mutable polyguanine (poly-G)
repeats located in non-coding genomic regions. Poly-G
mutations are present in a variety of human cancers.
In colon carcinoma, an association exists between pa-
tient age at diagnosis and tumor mutational burden,
suggesting that poly-G variants accumulate during nor-
mal division in colonic stem cells. Poorly dierentiated
colon carcinomas (which have a worse prognosis) have
fewer mutations than well-dierentiated tumors, possi-
bly indicating a shorter mitotic history of the founder
cell in these cancers. By presenting several patient case
studies, I will describe how poly-G ngerprints can be
used to construct phylogenetic trees that reect the evo-
lution of metastatic colon cancer, with an emphasis on
how biological considerations inform analysis strategies.

Roland Schwarz Cambridge Phylogenetic quantication
of intra-tumour heterogeneity Thursday, June 19, 2014
9:00 AM PDT
Tumour heterogeneity, i.e. the genomic diversity of
cancer cells within a single tumour, is thought to be
the source of chemotherapy resistance. In many can-
cers, this heterogeneity is not limited to point muta-
tions but includes large scale genomic rearrangements
and endoreduplications that lead to aberrant copy num-
ber (CN) proles. Reconstruction of the evolutionary
tree of cancer within the patient allows us to quantify
and understand the aetiology of tumour heterogene-
ity. In some cancers, such as high-grade serous ovarian
cancer (HGSOC), CN proles predominate. However54 EvolDir July 1, 2014
tree inference is hindered by unknown phasing of major
and minor CNs, horizontal dependencies between adja-
cent genomic loci and the lack of curated CN prole
databases to use as a reference for probabilistic infer-
ence.
We recently developed MEDICC (Minimum Event Dis-
tance for Intra-tumour Copy number Comparisons), an
algorithm for phylogenetic reconstruction based on CN
proles. MEDICC uses nite-state transducers (FSTs)
to encode a minimum evolution criterion that deter-
mines pairwise evolutionary distances between CN pro-
les. This minimum-event distance computes the small-
est number of amplication and deletions of arbitrary
length that are necessary to transform one genomic pro-
le into another. The FST-based approach allows us
thereby to model dependencies between sites, similar to
the problem of modelling indels on trees in traditional
phylogenetics. Using this approach we are able to phase
major and minor CN proles to the parental alleles and
infer trees and ancestral genomes, while minimizing the
overall tree length. The distance measure is formulated
such that the resulting matrix of pairwise distances has
a direct mapping to a positive semi-denite kernel ma-
trix. This allows us to perform principal component
analysis in evolutionary space and use this embedding
to numerically quantify tumour heterogeneity and other
quantities of interest, such as the degree of clonal ex-
pansion, using spatial statistics.
I will talk about the basics of FST-based phylogenetic
inference and explain how they can be used to model
genomic rearrangement events with horizontal depen-
dencies. I will explain how this approach implicitly
maps genomes into a feature space in which we can
quantify heterogeneity. Finally, I will present clinical
results that show how this quantication of ITH can
predict resistance development in the hospital.

SmallMammals
Volunteer opportunity as eld assistants for the project:
Evolution and Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the
Succulent Karoo of South Africa
Opportunity: This is a great opportunity for anybody
who wants to get more experience in eld work relat-
ing to eco-physiology, animal behavior, evolution, and
ecology before starting an MSc or PhD project.
Project: We study the evolutionary and ecological rea-
sons as well as physiological mechanisms of group living,
paternal care, communal nesting and social exibility
in the striped mouse. One focus is on the adaptation to
droughts, combining physiological, behavioral, ecologi-
cal and evolutionary research. As this species is diurnal
and the habitat is open, direct behavioral observations
in the eld are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students are preferred as
candidates. Applicants must have an interest inJuly 1, 2014 EvolDir 55
working in the eld and with animals. Hard working
conditions will await applicants, as the study species
gets up with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o` clock), and
stops its activity with dusk (19 o` clock). Work during
nights might also be necessary. Work in the eld will
be done for 5 days a week. Applicants must be able
to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at night in
winter, sometimes over 40 C during summer days).
Applicants must both be prepared to live for long
periods in the loneliness of the eld and to be part of
a small social group.
Work of volunteer eld assistants: Trapping, marking
and radio-tracking of striped mice; direct behavioral
observations in the eld. Volunteers will also see how
blood samples are collected for physiological measure-
ments. Volunteers are expected to help with mainte-
nance of the research station (water pump, solar power,
etc.).
Conrmation letter: Students get a letter of conrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their uni-
versity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
eld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
1300 (around 180 US$, 110 Euro) must be paid for ac-
commodation at the research station. Students must
buy their own food etc in Springbok (costs of about R
3000, approx. 360 US$ or 250 Euro/month). Includ-
ing extras (going out for dinner; shopping), you should
expect costs of about 600 US$ / 450 Euros per month.
Students get an invitation letter which they can use to
apply for funding in their home country.
Place: The eld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: At the moment we are looking
for one or two volunteers starting in July / August
2014 and for two volunteers starting in December 2014/
January 2015. Volunteers are expected to stay at least
three months, but longer periods of up to 6months are
preferred.

The Applied Evolutionary Epistemology Lab of the
Centre for Philosophy of Science of the University of56 EvolDir July 1, 2014
Lisbon is pleased to announce the publication of the
1st Volume ^Ain the New Springer Book Series Interdis-
ciplinary Evolution Research.
THE EVOLUTION OF SOCIAL COMMUNICA-
TION IN PRIMATES: A MULTIDISCIPLINARY AP-
PROACH Edited by Marco Pina & Nathalie Gontier
Book Abstract: How did social communication evolve
in primates? In this volume, primatologists, linguists,
anthropologists, cognitive scientists and philosophers of
science systematically analyze how their specic disci-
plines demarcate the research questions and methodolo-
gies involved in the study of the evolutionary origins of
social communication in primates in general, and in hu-
mans in particular. In the rst part of the book, histori-
ans and philosophers of science address how the episte-
mological frameworks associated with primate commu-
nication and language evolution studies have changed
over time, and how these conceptual changes aect our
current studies on the subject matter. In the sec-
ond part, scholars provide cutting-edge insights into
the various means through which primates commu-
nicate socially in both natural and experimental set-
tings. They examine the behavioral building blocks by
which primates communicate, and they analyze what
the cognitive requirements are for displaying commu-
nicative acts. Chapters highlight cross-fostering and
language experiments with primates, primate mother-
infant communication, the display of emotions and ex-
pressions, manual gestures and vocal signals, joint at-
tention, intentionality and theory of mind. The primary
focus of the third part is on how these various types
of communicative behavior possibly evolved, and how
they can be understood as evolutionary precursors to
human language. ^A Leading scholars analyze how both
manual and vocal gestures gave way to mimetic andimitational protolanguage, and how the latter possibly
transitioned into human language. In the nal part,
we turn to the hominin lineage, and anthropologists,
archeologists and linguists investigate what the nec-
essary neurocognitive, anatomical and behavioral fea-
tures are in order for human language to evolve, and
how language diers from other forms of primate com-
munication.

Population genomics of the X chromosome
A post doc position is available to work in the research
group of Mikkel Heide Schierup at the Bioinformatics
Research Centre at Aarhus University on comparative
evolutionary genomics of the X chromosome (and the
Y chromosome) in humans and other great apes. The
position is funded by the Danish National Research
Council for Independent Research and includes funds
for targeted experiments.
We have recently reported that the X chromosome is
under strong adaptive evolution (Hvilsom et al. 2012,
PNAS 10.1073/pnas.1106877109) and that it has diver-
sity patterns best explained by a large number of very
strong selective sweeps, independently occurring in sim-
ilar places in most great apes species, including humans
(Nam et al. 2013 arXiv:1402.5790v2). The candidate
will develop models and perform analyses to study this
pattern and test dierent hypotheses, including the pos-
sible involvement of X-ampliconic regions. The position
will exploit high coverage whole genome sequencing of
many individuals of each great apes species and phased
trio data from humans. There will also be the oppor-
tunity to do expression analysis using RNAseq of testis
samples and targeted resequencing of particular di-
cult regions, such as ampliconic regions. Furthermore,there will be the opportunity to join our participation in
international consortia for analysis of primate genomes.
A PhD degree and strong expertise in statistical anal-
ysis and population genetics is essential. Analyses will
require programming skills and familiarity with high
performance computing.
The position is initially for 1 year with possible ex-
tension for 1 more year. The starting salary depends
on qualications but is typically in the range of EUR
59,000-65,000 per annum, and there is often reduced
taxation for applicants which have not lived and worked
in Denmark for the past 3 years.
The working environment is the Bioinformatics Re-
search Center (www.birc.au.dk), which has a strong
emphasis on evolutionary analyses and includes the re-
search groups of Drs Thomas Mailund, Thomas Batail-
lon and Asger Hobolth with whom there are extensive
collaborations.
Informal inquiries are welcomed and should be sent to
Mikkel Heide Schierup at mheide@birc.au.dk. The ap-
plication with CV, list of publications and names of
three referees should also be sent to mheide@birc.au.dk
preferably before July 7. Starting date is negotiable,
but the position is available immediately.

MosquitoePopGenetics
Postdoc: Modeling Population Dynamics and Genetics
of Mosquito-vectored diseases
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Dengue is a mosquito-
vectored disease that aects over 100 million people
each year. With funding from the NIH and Gates Foun-68 EvolDir July 1, 2014
dation, we have developed a set of mathematical mod-
els ranging from simple to complex, aimed at assisting
the design and deployment of novel approaches for sup-
pressing transmission of dengue by its major mosquito
vector, Aedes aegypti. We are especially interested in
evaluating the potential utility of, as well as risks asso-
ciated with, using genetically engineered, selsh genetic
elements to drive genes into mosquito populations that
render them incapable of transmitting dengue fever.
Our work also extends to models relevant to suppress-
ing malaria.
Our most detailed model simulates the population dy-
namics and population genetics of Ae. aegypti in a city
on the Amazon river, Iquitos, for which there are rich
data sets on both mosquito dynamics and dengue epi-
demiology. An accompanying epidemiological model is
currently under development. Both are coded in C++.
We are just completing a large-scale experiment in Iq-
uitos to both test the model and collect data that can
be used to improve the parameterization of all Ae. ae-
gypti models. In the experiment, the mosquito popu-
lation in one area of the city is suppressed and then
allowed to return to normal densities. Although our
population dynamics model and many others have been
tested to determine if they predict equilibrium dynam-
ics, a much more stringent test is to determine if they
can predict response to a perturbation. Following a
transition period interfacing with our current postdoc,
the new postdoc will assume responsibility for leading
the analysis of these data and will further develop the
model to examine the dynamic behavior and ecacy of
a set of novel transgenic and non-transgenic approaches
for manipulating the mosquito population. These inno-
vative technologies and strategies are being developed
by our colleagues, so empirical data on small eld tests
will be available
. We are also building simple spatial and non-spatial,
deterministic models as heuristic tools for better under-
standing basic principles.
In addition to working on model development and anal-
ysis, and on comparisons between model and data,
the person in this position will collaborate in an in-
terdisciplinary research group composed of mosquito
ecologists, disease epidemiologists, molecular biolo-
gists, biomathematicians, ethicists, and scientists from
disease-endemic countries, in eorts to develop novel
transgenic strategies for disease reduction. The person
in this position will have the opportunity to spend time
in Iquitos to better understand the system being mod-
eled. Desirable skills include the ability to program
in C++ or knowledge of a related programming lan-
guage, statistical experience, particularly in parameterestimation and evaluation of performance of mechanis-
tic models.

Hello,
Please nd below the description of a postdoctoral po-
sition to 'Search for common genetic goods in gene fam-
ilies and microbial communities
The theory of genetic public goods recently postu-
lated that genetic sequences can be exploited in various
combinations, even by distantly related or unrelated
evolving entities, i.e. microbial communities benet-
ing from the sharing of genes between their members,
such as photosynthesis genes between cyanophages and
cyanobacteria, or such as drug resistance genes within
multispecies biolm. Yet, the nature, size and diversity
of microbial communities sharing such genetic goods re-
main poorly known. Moreover, the rules of gene sharing
also remain to be described.
A wealth of molecular data from metagenomic, single
cell metagenomic, and microbial genomes projects is
now available to tackle these fundamental issues. Fur-
thermore, sequence similarity networks oer a promis-
ing complementary niche to phylogenetic methods to
exploit the complexity of these data. These graphs al-
low for mathematical analyses of genetic diversity and
similarities over dozens of millions of sequences, pro-
viding novel ways to detect clubs of genomes, which
have not necessarily evolved from a single last com-
mon ancestor yet exploit some common genetic mate-
rial. Likewise, these networks allows for the detection
of some sets of gene families that exploit common pools
of genetic fragments/domains.
To further develop the detection strategies of genetic
public goods, our lab is now looking for a post-doctoral
fellow in bio-informatics, who will be funded for up to
three years by an ERC grant (for a salary of 45,000
euros/year; approximately 2219 euros/ month after
taxes). The candidate will take advantage of graph
properties and algorithms from the graph theory: - toimprove the identication of clubs of genomes /sets of
gene and their pool of genetic goods in complex net-
works with a few millions nodes and dozens of mil-
lions of edges; - to analyze domains combinations in
genes and gene sharing in communities, using bipar-
tite graphs. - He/she will then analyze the functions of
these genetic goods and their distribution across genes
and genomes to test what lifestyles favors their sharing.
The candidate will work within a consortium of friendly
bioinformaticians (Philippe Lopez), evolutionary biol-
ogists (Eric Bapteste), and graph theorists (Michel
Habib, Laurent Viennot), and be hosted in the Uni-
versity Pierre and Marie Curie in the center of Paris,
France. The current team description and publica-
tions can be found at: http://www.evol-net.fr/ Ideally,
the candidate should have a good background in bio-
informatics, or graph theory and a strong interest for
evolutionary biology. The position will start by Novem-
ber 2014, but interested candidates are invited to apply
immediately.
Applicants are requested to send a detailed resume,
a motivation letter, a pdf copy of their PhDs the-
sis, and the names of two scientic referees to :

tions are funded by an NSF grant to study the genetics
and evolution of behavioral immune defenses that fruit
ies use to avoid or cure infection by parasitic wasps.Behaviors are increasingly seen as an important compo-

found that larval ies escape wasp infection and cure in-
fection by utilizing more alcoholic food substrates (Mi-

BdelloidRotifers EvolGenomics
*Postdoctoral position in Evolutionary Genomics and
Molecular and Cellular biology * *(UCL - UNamur,
Belgium)*
**
A 3-year postdoctoral research position is available to
investigate the */Molecular and cellular mechanisms of
hyper-resistance to stress in the ameiotic bdelloid ro-
tifer /Adineta vaga. *The research will be conducted
in the group of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Molecular
Genetics of Micro-organisms at the Catholic University
of Louvain (UCL, Belgium) to take part in a collabora-
tive ARC research program with the Research Units in
Environmental and Evolutionary Biology (URBE) and
in Cellular Biology (URBC) at the University of Namur
(UNamur, Belgium).
This postdoc position is embedded within the research
project entitled: /Asexuality and 'immortality', bdel-
loid rotifers as an evolutionary 'scandal' and a model
system in biology. /This project is funded during 5
years and will start in October 2014.
* PIs of the project:*
*Prof. Bernard Hallet (ISV, UCL), Prof. Karine Van
Doninck (URBE, UNamur), *Dr. Florence Debacq-
Chainiaux (URBC, UNamur)**
The involved consortium brings together experts in
the elds of evolutionary biology and genomics of
bdelloid rotifers (K. Van Doninck, URBE, UNamur),
DNA recombination and genome plasticity (B. Hallet,
ISV, UC) and oxidative stress response (F. Debacq-
Chainiaux, URBC, UNamur). The appointed candi-
date will be expected to share its research time on both
sites under the supervision of the three PIs of the con-
sortium. The universities are at a distance of 35km
from each other and easily connected by train.
*Project:*
Bdelloid rotifers are micro-organisms (animals) that
have recently attracted much interest in the scientic
community because of their ancient asexuality and their
extreme resistance to stress, such as desiccation and
high doses of ionizing radiation. They are capable
to survive when their genome is shattered into small
fragments and repair the DNA double strands breaks(DSBs) *(see Hespeels et al., JEB 2014)*. Repeated
cycles of chromosomal repair are thought to promote al-
lelic recombination and gene conversion in the absence
of meiosis. Moreover desiccation and the induced DNA
DSBs are also thought to provide a unique opportu-
nity to acquire horizontally transferred genes, thereby
contributing to the adaptive success of these organisms.
In this project, the mechanisms that make bdelloid
rotifers unique in terms of evolutionary strategy and
hyper-resistance to stress will be investigated based on
genomic data recently obtained by our consortium for
the bdelloid rotifer /Adineta vaga/ headed by Prof.
Karine Van Doninck (*see Flot et al, 2013, Nature
500:453-7*). Genomic approaches will be used to study
the dynamics of /A. vaga/ genome during cycles of
desiccation/rehydration/radiationand to decipher the
genetic expression program that governs the dier-
ent stages of its life-style. Molecular and cellular ap-
proaches will be developed to unveil and characterize
the mechanisms that allow /A. vaga/ to repair its shat-
tered chromosomes and generate genetic diversity,as
well as its dependence with respect to oxidative stress
response. The ultimate prospect of the project is to es-
tablish bdelloid rotifers as a new model system for the
understanding of fundamental biological processes such
as DNA repair, cell survival and senescence.

A postdoctoral position is immediately available in the
Smith lab at the University of Guelph (Ontario) in the
application of DNA-based diagnostics in the early de-
tection of species involved in predating upon the spruce
budworm (SBW). In particular, experience in the de-
sign and implementation of microarrays is necessary.
Applicants should have a Ph.D. and extensive training
and experience in one or more of the following areas:July 1, 2014 EvolDir 75
DNA extraction, PCR, qPCR and microarray develop-
ment. The ideal candidate will also have broad training
in evolutionary biology, strong writing skills, and prior
management experience.
The successful applicant will play a key role in a re-
cently funded project to develop and apply new meth-
ods involving DNA-based diagnostics for the rapid iden-
tication natural enemies of the spruce budworm in
New Brunswick. The spruce budworm (SBW - Choris-
toneura fumiferana) is the major coniferous forest pest
in eastern North America.
The goal of this project is to design a DNA-based
diagnostic for these critical, but dicult to quantify
and identify the complement of natural enemies (insect
parasitoids and pathogens) that act as natural control
agents. To do so, we will adapt, and augment, the exist-

sequences) into a DNA microarray chip enabling us to
rapidly identify and quantify the many organisms that
interact directly ( >100 species of natural enemies) and
indirectly (other conifer-feeding species that serve as al-
ternate/alternative hosts of SBW parasitoids) with the
spruce budworm and form the so-called \spruce bud-
worm food web".

June 2019; see project overview below). Hawaii is world
renowned as an ideal setting for evolutionary studies,
and Hilo and the Big Island boast exceptional cultural
and natural diversity and a high standard of living.
This is an exciting opportunity to work with a di-
verse team of researchers working collaboratively on
the common theme of organismal response to environ-
mental change. The successful candidate will join a
team of 9 faculty, 3 technicians, and several gradu-
ate students studying the short-term (stress response)
and long-term (adaptation) responses of a broad range
of terrestrial and marine organisms to environmental
change, broadly dened.
The postdoc will provide expertise in the application of
bioinformatics analyses and will work alongside project
personnel and collaborating bioinformaticists on cam-
pus and at outside institutions on the analysis of ge-
nomics and transcriptomics data to meet project goals.
Responsibilities will include: collaborating in the de-
sign of experiments and analysis of data from next-
generation sequencing instruments, including RNA-
Sequencing, SNP, and full-genome sequencing data; as-
sisting in the management of genomic data and associ-
ated phenotypic trait data on various local data storage
systems; and preparation of manuscripts, reports and
presentations.
CREST Project Overview: The overarching theme of
this project is Understanding Biotic Response to Envi-
ronmental Change in Tropical Ecosystems Through a
Place-Based Context. This CREST:TCBES proposal
focuses on three synergistic research themes: 1) Or-
ganismal Response to Environmental Change (OREC):
While local adaptation along environmental gradients
and tracking of changing environments involve short-
term acclimation and longer term evolution, it is not
known if organisms are responding to average environ-
mental conditions or to the extreme conditions expe-
rienced in their habitats. The OREC team will ex-
amine the short- and long-term responses of key or-76 EvolDir July 1, 2014
ganisms to a range of environmental conditions, both
steady and uctuating, and will incorporate those re-
sults into models of landscape-level response to climate
change. 2) Behavioral Responses to Environmental
Change (BREC): Behaviors central to the survival and
reproductive success of animals have evolved through
natural and sexual selection in a far dierent ecological
environment than exists today. The BREC team will
use emerging genetic and acoustic tools to examine the
eect of anthropogenic change on important social be-
haviors in animals ranging from arthropods to whales.
3) Dynamic Interactions between Symbioses and En-
vironment (DISE): Macro-organisms live in symbiosis
with a community of microorganisms; these symbiotic
relationships can shift in response to environmental
changes. The DISE team will explore adaptations of the
mutualism-pathogenesis-parasitism continuum in mul-
tiple symbiotic systems. Integration of next-generation
DNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis in each of
the research areas
will allow unprecedented insight into the molecular ba-
sis of biotic responses to environmental change.
As teaching experience is an important component of
the postdoctoral experience, the postdoc will also be
encouraged to teach one course or workshop per year
at UH Hilo at the graduate** or undergraduate level in
his/her area of expertise.
**Tropical Conservation Biology and Environmental
Science Graduate Program
http://tcbes.uhh.hawaii.edu/ The position is for one
year, renewable.
The successful candidate will be a self-starter and
creative problem solver with strong communication
and interpersonal skills. Minimum qualications:
PhD involving bioinformatics analysis on an evolu-
tionary problem, experience with genomic techniques
and bioinformatics analysis. Desired qualications:
software development and implementation for multi-

Best regards, Tord
Two postdocs: Metapopulation dynamics in hierarchi-
cal, dynamic landscapes The Swedish Species Informa-
tion Centre is a national centre for knowledge on biodi-
versity. Our work includes compiling and storing bio-
diversity data and assessing the viability of species in
Sweden. We are currently recruiting two postdocs who
will work on the spatial dynamics of sessile species liv-
ing in hierarchically structured, dynamic landscapes.
We are seeking two postdocs who will work within three
subject areas: metapopulation dynamics of species
with dierent life-history traits; development of mod-
els for metapopulation dynamics of sessile species us-
ing solely distribution pattern data; dispersal range
estimation combining modelling of data on metapop-
ulation dynamics and spatial genetic structuring. We
have data on metapopulation dynamics and local abun-
dance growth from repeated surveys of epiphytes and
their host trees starting around 2000. We also have
samples from the entire metapopulation of one model
species (Lobaria pulmonaria) to be used for the popu-
lation genetic studies. One aim of these studies based
on systematically collected data from repeated surveys
is to evaluate our ongoing metapopulation modelling
based on Citizen Science Data that has been reported
to www.artportalen.se. The model system is epiphytic
bryophytes and lichens living in hierarchically struc-
tured, dynamic forest landscapes. The work is funded
by the Swedish Research Council.

USheeld GenomicsOfSpeciation
A two-year postdoc is available for a creative and mo-
tivated person to work on the genomics of adaptation
and speciation in Timema stick insects. The postdoc
will work with Patrik Nosil in the Department of An-
imal and Plant Sciences at the University of Sheeld
(also in close collaboration with Zach Gompert at Utah
State University).
The position is funded by an European Research Coun-
cil grant focused on testing hypotheses about how
genomes evolve as species formation unfolds from be-
ginning to end. One major goal is to directly isolate
the role of the process of natural selection in gener-
ating observed patterns of genomic divergence between
host-associated populations and species of stick insects.
The approach is to combine ^ astandard' observational
whole genome sequencing with eld transplants experi-
mentally measuring selection at the genomic level. The
results will provide insight into the temporal and ge-
nomic dynamics of speciation. For an example of the
types of questions and data to be handled see Soria-
Corrasco et al. 2014 in Science.
What we require: The postdoctoral fellow will be re-
sponsible for leading hypothesis-driven analyses of large
DNA sequence data sets (i.e., genome-scale data from
100's of individuals). A Ph.D. is required. The suc-

A postdoc position is available to work with Dr Kai
Zeng and Prof Jon Slate at the University of Sheeld.
The position is funded by the Natural Environment
Research Council (NERC) to carry out population ge-
nomic studies in great tits (/Parus major/). Ques-
tions of interest include examining how demography
and natural selection shape patterns of diversity across
the genome, by using existing methods and developing
new methods. The project involves whole-genome se-
quencing of multiple great tit individuals using high-
throughput sequencing instruments, and the subse-
quent bioinformatic/population genetic analysis of the
data. Therefore, expertise in population/evolutionary
genetics, computer programming and statistical anal-
ysis of large-scale datasets is essential. Experience in
preparing DNA samples for high-throughput sequenc-
ing instruments is an advantage, but non-essential.
The post is available for up to 3 years, and is available

WORKSHOP
SOCIAL EVOLUTION: MERITS AND LIMITA-
TIONS OF INCLUSIVE FITNESS THEORY
WHEN: 13-15 July 2014 WHERE: Arolla (Swiss Alps)
DESCRIPTION: Inclusive tness theory is generally
assumed to suciently explain the evolution of social
behaviour. However, empirical evidence is accumulat-
ing that other evolutionary concepts need to be involved
to explain cooperation and social structure in a widerange of taxa. This includes the archetypical exam-
ples of altruism, like the reproductive division of labour
in eusocial hymenoptera and the cooperative breeding
groups observed in many vertebrates. Recent evidence
from insects and vertebrates reveals that high levels of
relatedness can even reduce rather than further coop-
eration and altruism.
The aim of this workshop is to combine pertinent evolu-
tionary theoreticians and empiricists to discuss comple-
mentary evolutionary mechanisms to inclusive tness
theory. This is a topic of great interest to students and
biologists in general, because there is a growing aware-
ness that explanations based on inclusive tness, which
have dominated the theoretical and empirical literature
for the past half century, cannot account for many ex-
amples of apparently altruistic behaviour observed inJuly 1, 2014 EvolDir 85

This course provides an overview of the interface be-
tween geometric morphometrics and phylogenetics. It
aims to give an overview of the dierent approaches and
methods that link the two elds and to enable partic-ipants to apply them to their own research problems.
Lectures that introduce concepts and methods are inte-
grated with demonstrations of software that put them
into practice right away. The main emphasis is on map-
ping shape data on existing phylogenies to reconstruct
the evolutionary history of shape diversication, as well
as comparative methods that take phylogeny into ac-
count. To enhance the practical approach of the course,
participants are encouraged to bring their own data to
conduct analyses and discuss results.

EvolutionaryBiol
Dear EvolDir members:
The Master in Evolutionary Biology at Complutense
University of Madrid (Spain) is about to open its ap-
plication period for the new course, starting in autumn
2014.
The Master is an ocial postgraduate program directed
to students seeking a comprehensive introduction to the
major questions in evolutionary biology. To complete
the program, students have to complete 60 ECTS cred-
its. All students take four compulsory courses (The ge-
netic basis of evolution, Natural selection and adapta-
tion, Phylogenetic systematics, Patterns and processes
in macroevolution, each 6 ECTS) and produce a Mas-
ter's Thesis (12 ECTS). The program is completed with
four more 6-credit courses, to be chosen among the
following: Molecular phylogenies, Phylogeography and
its applications, Animal phylogeny, Evolution and phy-
logeny of plants, Life-history evolution, Mechanisms of
speciation in plants, Principles of experimental design,
Data analysis in ecology and evolution, and Methods
in evolutionary biology.
Information about the Master: www.ucm.es/biologia-
evolutiva Prospective students will have three dierent
deadlines to submit applications:
- Early application: 20 March - 10 April 2014. This
early application is designed for students who need an
admission letter in order to apply for travel grants or

Environmental Genomics/399/ The faculty at
MDIBL is pleased to again oer a training course in
Environmental Genomics, aiming to better understand
technologies and approaches used to discover how gene
function is inuenced by environmental conditions
while accounting for variation that exists within and
among natural populations. This course is built on the
paradigm that the research eld will most eectively
grow by properly designing large-scale experiments en-
abled by drastically increased sample-throughput and
lower sequencing costs. Most importantly, the bioin-
formatics challenges of manipulating and analysing
population-level genomics data must be addressed.^ a^ a
This course is designed to train the next-generation of
environmental scientists, which have included in past
years: university professors, postdoctoral researchers,
doctoral students and government scientists, represent-
ing institutions from North America and Europe. Most
responded in the departure survey that the course cur-
riculum, choice of technologies, and eectiveness pro-
vided sucient training to either begin or enlarge an
environmental genomics project in their own labora-
tories. All reported that they would recommend this
course to a colleague.
This course trains researchers to design studies, and
to collect and analyse RNA-Seq gene expression data.
Daphnia is used for training because of its growing
use as a model system for environmental genomics and
for improving environmental health protection, yet the
skills learned during the course will be applicable to
all study systems with maturing genomics resources.
Much time is devoted to guiding the current and future
projects of attendees.90 EvolDir July 1, 2014
Ultimately, participants will be better positioned to
incorporate these technologies into their own research
laboratories, while better understanding how functional
genomics and automation can be applied to ecology,
evolution and environmental toxicology.^ a

An introduction to bioinformatic tools for metagenetic
and population genomic data analysis,
2.0 higher education credits Course description This
course aims at detailed understanding and hands-on
experience of using state of the art bioinformatics
pipelines for one's own biological research questions.
An important aspect of the course is to show how ge-
nomic data can be applied to address and answer re-
search questions in the elds of genetics, ecology, pop-
ulation biology, biodiversity monitoring and conserva-
tion. The students will be trained in the latest bioinfor-
matic methods to analyze high throughput sequencing
data, which is present in many research projects. The
course will cover basic computing tools required to run
command line applications, processing high throughput
sequencing data of the CO1 gene from environmental
samples to reveal biodiversity and analysis of sequenc-
ing data from whole genome scans for population ge-
nomic studies.
The rst part of the course introduces general com-
puting tools for beginners such as the UNIX com-
mand line environment, bash commands, data format-
ting using regular expressions and basic scripting in
the unix shell with a series of examples and exer-
cises. The course introduces bioinformatics software
for analysis of sequence data from metagenetics (The
high-throughput sequencing of a molecular marker from
an ecosystem or a community of organisms, used for
large-scale analyses of biodiversity), through a series
of live demonstrations (AmpliconNoise, TaxAssign, QI-
IME). The course also introduces basic and advanced
concepts of population genomics data analysis such as
genome/transcriptome assembly, annotation (BLAST),
alignment/mapping, dierential Gene expression, func-
tional enrichment tests, SNP genotyping, PCA, outlier
tests. The course corresponds to 1 week of full time
studies and and is composed of lectures, demonstra-
tions and computer labs.
Preliminary course schedule - Day 1: Introduction to
general computing tools Format: 3 hours lecture and
demo sessions, 3 hours computer labs, assigned exer-
cises
Day 1 of the course will be an introduction to general
computing tools, such as the unix command line envi-
ronment. We will go through bash commands (less,
nano, ls, ll, wc, j, tail, head, mkdir, cat, grep, for
loop), regular expressions, basic scripting, and running
python scripts from the unix shell with a series of exam-July 1, 2014 EvolDir 91
ples. Exercises and assignments will be based on Had-
dock and Dunn ^ aPractical Computing for biologists'
and can be carried out independently. There will also
be a presentation of useful bioinformatics software.
This portion of the course is to refresh the students'
knowledge of the command line environment and the
shell, a tool for interacting with the computer through
typed instructions at the command line. Exercise ses-
sions will be carried out in pairs to encourage collabora-
tive problem solving. All lectures will be made dynamic
through live demonstrations of the command line. De-
tailed course material including commands and scripts
will be available through the course web page.
This part of the course corresponds to learning outcome
2a: ^ aAbility to use basic commands in the Unix com-
mand line environment' (reformatting data with regu-
lar expressions, basic scripting, running python scripts
from the unix shell)
Days 2 and 3: Metagenetic data analysis pipelines For-
mat: Lectures and live demonstrations of software
Days 2 and 3 will focus on analysis of a high-throughput
sequencing dataset from an environmental sample.
This approach allows us to gather novel data on species
composition of a sample for biodiversity

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral92 EvolDir July 1, 2014
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
