September 2009 in Berlin, Germany.
As several people have indicated that they need more
time, we have decided to extend the deadline to 27th
June 2009. For those who have not registered yet,
please do so: http://www.bayceer.uni-bayreuth.de/-
izw7/ The main topics of the conference are: - Life His-
tory & Maternal Eﬀects (Pat Monaghan, Universtity of
Glasgow, UK) - Stress & Disturbance (Marco Apollo-
nio, Universita Sassari, Sardinien, Italy) - Reproduction
Biology (David Wildt, Smithsonian National Zoological
Park, USA) - Evolutionary Genomics in Conservation
(Pierre Taberlet, Universit´ e Joseph Fourier, Grenoble,July 1, 2009 EvolDir 3
France) - Conservation Biology (Eric Dinerstein, Direc-
tor of science WWF-USA, Washington, USA)
The Conference oﬀers several workshops: 1. Evolution-
ary Genomics in Conservation (Pierre Taberlet, Univer-
sit´ e Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, France & Simone Som-
mer, IZW, Berlin, Germany) Natural populations carry
a wealth of molecular variation and there is increasing
evidence that a large proportion of it has functionally
diverged. Thus, understanding the functional implica-
tions of genetic variation provides not only insights into
evolutionary processes and selection pressures but also
into the adaptive potential of natural populations to a
changing environment. Thereby, recent advances in se-
quencing and genome scan technologies have changed
our focus from a few to thousands of genes. Moreover,
the fundamental role of gene expression in shaping phe-
notypes has been recognized. Until recently, mainly
sequence variation was taken into account so far disre-
garding expression diﬀerences between alleles. The aim
of this workshop is to share information and discuss re-
search applying a genomic approach or investigations of
the role of gene expression in wildlife species to gain a
more profound understanding of the variation of genes
and their function in evolution, ecology and conserva-
tion.
2. Communication in Mammals and Birds (Francesco
Bonnadonna, Centre d’Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evo-
lutive, Montpellier, France & Martin Dehnhard, IZW,
Berlin, Germany)
3. Welfare and Conservation (Eric Dinerstein, se-
nior scientist WWF-USA, Washington, USA & Marion
East, IZW, Berlin, Germany)
4. Stable Isotopes, Nutrition and Energetics (Carlos

Evolutionary Biology in Portugal. They are held in late
December to allow researchers in foreign institutions to
attend, given that many spend their Winter break in
Portugal.
To celebrate this special year, we will have Prof. Dou-
glas Futuyma (Stony Brook University, NY, USA) as
an invited speaker. The remainder presenters will be
either Portuguese or working in Portugal.
Presenters should register by sending a message to bi-
ologia.evolutiva@gmail.com with the following informa-
tion: - Presentation title, - Name and aﬃliation, - Topic
Portuguese and English will be the oﬃcial languages of
the meeting.
Also, we are happy to announce that we will discuss the
creation of the Portuguese Evolutionary Biology Asso-
ciation. This idea has been on table for some time now
and we will decide if this is the time to formalize it.
We will soon have further information. We would ap-
preciate ample distribution of this announcement.Best regards,

SAGE2009 Conference - “Southeast Asian Gateway
Evolution”
14-17 September 2009: Royal Holloway University of
London
http://sage2009.rhul.ac.uk The Southeast Asian Gate-
way is the site of the Indonesian Throughﬂow between
the Paciﬁc and Indian Oceans. It is the only low lat-
itude link between the world’s oceans, and is increas-
ingly regarded as an important inﬂuence on global cli-
mate. The throughﬂow passes through the present zone
of collision between Australia and SE Asia. The colli-
sion began about 25 million years ago, but SE Asia
has a long history of growth by the addition of conti-
nental fragments rifted from Gondwana dating back to
the Palaeozoic. The fauna and ﬂora display a similar
complexity which is partly linked to the geology.
There is a centre of maximum diversity in the ma-
rine and terrestrial ecosystems in the Indo-Australian
archipelago, and the gateway contains numerous bio-
geographic boundaries. The centre of the region, known
to biologists as Wallacea after Alfred Russel Wallace of
Wallace’s Line, is an unusual region of high faunal and
ﬂoral endemicity. Plate tectonic reconstructions sug-
gest that geology has played a major role in shaping
the distributions of biota and the tectonic development
of the region is one key to understanding the links be-
tween oceanic circulation, climate and life. However,
these links are not well documented and connections
between diﬀerent processes are uncertain. Understand-
ing the geological and biological history of the region,
and the evolution of biodiversity, is of considerable im-
portance in managing current and future change.
This will be a three-day multidisciplinary meeting to
discuss this important region with an emphasis on re-
porting new ideas and exchanging views between a wide
range of Earth and Life Scientists. It will promote in-
teraction between Earth and Life Scientists working in
the region. The programme will include plenary ses-
sions, overview presentations, and breakouts for spe-
cialist groups. We seek contributions on all geological
and biological aspects of the Southeast Asian Gateway,
the region including Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philip-
pines, Indochina, New Guinea and the NW Shelf of
Australia.

Macedonia SpeciationInLakes
Sep7-11
This is an announcement for the International Sympo-
sium
Speciation in Ancient Lakes 5, SIAL5, September 7-11
2009, Ohrid, Macedonia.
Ancient lakes, that is, extant lakes that have contin-
uously existed throughout the last glaciation or since
before the Pleistocene, for example, lakes Baikal, Tan-
ganyika, Malawi, Biwa, and Ohrid, have long been rec-
ognized as centres of biodiversity. Moreover, during the
past years, speciation in ancient lakes has emerged as
an important and fruitful topic in studies of evolution-
ary biology. The current understanding of a number
of key evolutionary concepts, such as sympatric speci-
ation, sexual selection, adaptive radiation, hybridiza-
tion, and punctuated equilibrium, is in part based on
insights from speciation studies in these ancient lakes,
and this is evident in the increasing number of citations
of articles pertaining to speciation in ancient lakes.
A series of conferences on Speciation In Ancient Lakes
(SIAL) was started by a meeting that took place 1993
in Mont-Rigi, Belgium, and was brought together to
review the state of art in the ﬁeld for a ﬁrst time since
the classical seminal review of Brooks (1950). The pro-
ceedings of that meeting initiated a wealth of renewed
interest in ancient lake issues.
The second SIAL meeting entitled “International Con-
ference on Ancient Lakes: their Biological and Cultural
Diversities” was held in 1997 near Lake Biwa in Japan.
It focused on the cultural diversity of ancient lakes, as
well as on their biodiversity, ecology and evolution. The
third conference, SIAL-3, took place in Irkutsk. Nat-
urally, the focus of that conference was the oldest and8 EvolDir July 1, 2009
arguably most famous of the ancient lakes - Lake Baikal.
Finally, the latest meeting SIAL-4 was held September
4-8, 2006, at the Freie Universit¨ at Berlin, Germany.

GENETIC TRANSFER and MODERN PHY-
LOGENY A tribute to Elie Wollman.
Elie Wollman, who died last year, was one of the pi-
oneers who established Molecular Genetics. Together
with Fran¸ cois Jacob, he made use of the “sexuality of
bacteria” to decipher the nature of the conjugation pro-
cess in bacteria, as well as the basis of prophage induc-
tion. He played also a key role in the modernization of
the Pasteur Institute. A meeting in his honor will take
place at the Institut Pasteur Paris, on October 2. It
will encompass the following themes:
Historical accounts: Charles Galperin, Michel Mor-
ange. The nature of viruses: Max Gottesman, Patrick
Forterre. Horizontal gene transfers and phylogeny in
the bacterial kingdoms : Simonetta Gribaldo, Elisa-
beth Carniel. >From single colonies to single molecules:
Jean-Fran¸ cois Allemand. Conjugation and recombina-
tion. Where do we stand? Miroslav Radman.
Registration is free but, because space islimited, pre-registration will be required at:
Denise.Derhy@pasteur.fr.
The meeting comprises two events: An exhibit. Start-
ing with the day of the meeting, it will describe Woll-
man’s scientiﬁc achievements and its administrative ca-

Organizers: Qazi Rahman (QMUL) and Tom Dickins
(EHBEA)
This symposium celebrates 200 years of Darwin’s birth
and 150 years since the publication of The Origin. It
also coincides with the launch of a new undergradu-
ate degree in Psychology at the School of Biological &
Chemical Sciences (QMUL) which is underpinned by an
evolutionary framework. We acknowledge the generous
support of the European Human Behaviour & Evolu-
tion Association (EHBEA), The Galton Institute and
the School of Biological & Chemical Sciences (QMUL).
Meeting abstract
In the distant future I see open ﬁelds of far more im-
portant researches. Psychology will be based on a new
foundation that of the necessary acquirement of each
mental power and capacity by gradation. Light will be
thrown on the origin of man and history. (p394, The
Origin, 1859/1996) Darwin published The Origin 150
years ago. From that point on he, and many others,
have applied evolutionary theory to behaviour. And
from that point on controversy has never been far away.
Darwin’s own work contributed to the rise of Compar-
ative Psychology in the late nineteenth century, which
in turn impacted upon Behaviourism. The 1970s saw
the rise of Sociobiology, and much criticism of attempts
to apply evolutionary biology to human concerns. Ini-
tially these criticisms were grounded in Marxist ide-
ology and set limits to the remit of biological science:July 1, 2009 EvolDir 11
human properties required a diﬀerent framework. More
recently the humanities and social sciences have taken a
similar view but with a post-modern twist, actively es-
chewing scientiﬁc, and especially biological understand-
ing, and in so doing forsaking prediction.
In spite of this history of ideological criticism, what
might be termed the Human Evolutionary Behavioural
Sciences (HEBS) have diversiﬁed into Evolutionary
Psychology, Human Behavioural Ecology and Cultural
Evolution, and in so doing have ﬂourished. In this
meeting we hope to showcase new and exciting work
from within HEBS, and look at where eﬀorts should be
focused in the future. It is our contention that the hu-
manities and social sciences cannot ignore the central
place of evolution as a theoretical framework for under-
standing human aﬀairs. What is more, if we ever hope
to practically help others we need to fully understand
the nature of the species at hand. Scientiﬁc scrutiny is
the only option, and evolutionary biology is the unify-
ing framework. Speakers

The Role of Behaviour in Speciation; EU funded work-
shop at the University of St Andrews, Scotland.
A workshop for early career stage researchers will be
held at the University of St Andrews, Scotland on 20-
22nd August 2009. This is funded by an EU Initial
Training Network grant entitled Speciation awarded
to laboratories in the UK, Netherlands and Finland.
Space is available for a limited number of external par-
ticipants. Applications are invited, and delegates are
expected to be at the Masters, PhD or early postdoc-
toral research stage. There are no nationality restric-
tions.
Speakers and discussion leaders are Mohamed Noor
(Duke University, USA), Richard Harrison (Cornell
University, USA), Anne Magurran (St Andrews, UK),
Nathan Bailey (Riverside, CA, USA), Thomas Schmitt
(Freiburg University, Germany) and Constantino Ma-
cias Garcia (UNAM, Mexico). The format will include
lectures, discussions and some hands-on exercises.
The research programmes funded under the EU award
include studies of population genetics and sexual isola-
tion in a range of organisms, several Drosophila sys-
tems, other insects (orthoptera and Nasonia), ma-
rine polychaetes and theoretical studies of diversiﬁca-
tion. Common questions concern genomic studies of be-
havioural variation, including QTL and candidate gene
analyses for song and chemical traits, and studies of
population genetics and reproductive isolation. Addi-
tional topics to be addressed at the workshop include
the role of learning and plasticity in reproductive isola-
tion.
There are a number of bursaries for external par-
ticipants. Enquiries can be made to Mike Ritchie
(mgr@st-and.ac.uk) and application procedures (work-
shop attendance and bursary) will be posted at http:/-
/speciation.group.shef.ac.uk/ or can be obtained from
him. The deadline for the receipt of applications is June
30th.
Exact registration fees will be calculated soon, but will
be modest, certainly no more than 100 payable upon
attendance.
This meeting immediately follows a three day sum-
mer school and one day conference on ComparativeGenomics at the University of St Andrews, organised
by the Scottish Bioinformatics Forum, and researchers
with overlapping interest may wish to attend either or
both of these meetings. Details are available at: http:/-

UGhent EvolutionOfDispersal
Sep14-15
International symposium - University of Ghent, Bel-
gium September 14 and 15, 2009 Dispersal is a cen-
tral process within metapopulation and metacommu-
nity ecology. Because it has many evolutionary, popu-
lation dynamical and applied consequences, we aim to
bring together international expertise within dispersal
ecology by presenting and discussing currently ongoing
research themes.
We are happy to invite you to an international sympo-
sium with special focus on the ecology and evolution of
dispersal that will be held at the University of Ghent
in Belgium. The meeting will deal with both concep-
tual and applied issues, with empirical, experimental
and theoretical approaches, and we will present knowl-
edge of dispersal patterns and mechanisms in plants,
animals and micro-organisms. The symposium oﬀers
a diverse and attractive series of talks including four
keynote papers. It is a pleasure to host several interna-
tional authorities in the ﬁeld.We encourage participants, and students in particular,
to present their research on any theoretical or applied
aspect of dispersal by poster presentations.
The Symposium is sponsored by FWO (Fund of Scien-
tiﬁc Research, Flanders, Belgium).

Dear Evoldir members,
We are pleased to announce the third meeting of the Eu-
ropean Society for Evolutionary Developmental Biology
(EED). This meeting will be held from 6 to 9 July 2010
at the Universit´ e Paris Diderot, Paris 7, along the left
bank of the Seine, adjacent to the new library building,
the Biblioth` eque Nationale de France, Fran¸ cois Mitter-
rand.
We are very pleased that Didier Casane, Michel Ver-
voort and Patrick Laurenti are willing to be the local
organizers at the Universit´ e Paris Diderot, Paris 7.
We invite you to SUBMIT PROPOSALS FOR SYM-
POSIA.
It is the aim of EED to stimulate the communication
between sub-disciplines. We, therefore, particularly en-
courage submission of symposia on broad and integra-
tive topics of potential interest to researchers from dif-
ferent ﬁelds (e.g. developmental biology, genetics, pa-
leontology, genomics, theoretical biology). Symposia
that combine animal and plant studies are also wel-
come.
Symposia should, if possible, accommodate 8 invited
speakers and allow 25 minutes for each speaker (20’ talk
and 5’ discussion). A small number of mini-symposia
with 3 speakers (also 25’) will also be considered.
Please note that invited speakers can only present in a
single symposium.
Please include the following information in your pro-
posal for a symposium:

OhioU Papaveraceae EvoDevo
A teaching assistantship is available in the Depart-
ment of Environmental and Plant Biology, Ohio Univer-
sity, to study the genetic control of reproductive mor-
phological diversity in Papaveraceae. The project in-
vestigates links between inﬂorescence architecture and
ﬂower symmetry in the morphologically diverse Pa-
paveraceae. Poppies and fumitories represent a new
model lineage at the base of the eudicots. We have
identiﬁed homologs of FLORICAULA, FRUITFULL,
TERMINAL FLOWER1, and CYCLOIDEA genes in
order to study their role in inﬂorescence determinacy,
eﬄoration sequence, and ﬂower symmetry in a set of
key species.
The project involves (i) cloning and phylogenetic char-
acterization of additional genes from a broader sam-
pling of species, (ii) a comparative morphological study
of inﬂorescence and ﬂower development, (iii) the char-
acterization of gene expression patterns using RT-PCR
and in situ hybridization, and (iv) phenotypic analyses
of eﬀects of modulated expression using virus-induced
gene silencing (VIGS) and Agrobacterium-mediated
transformation. As part of this eﬀort, VIGS will be
adapted to fumitory species.
Candidates for this position should have a strong in-
terest in plant development and evolution, and demon-
strable experience in some of the methods mentioned.
The ability to work independently and self- motivated
is essential. The student will join a lab with vibrant re-
search spanning from the organismal to the molecular
level.
Please send a cover letter, a curriculum vitae, GRE
scores, a statement of research experience that also ex-
plains what speciﬁcally attracts you to this particular
project, and the names and contact information of at
least two scientists available for reference. Please send

MosquitoPopulationGenetics
A Master of Science graduate student position is avail-
able (starting asap) in the laboratory of Michel Slotman
in the department of Entomology at Texas A&M Uni-
versity to study the population genetics of the malaria
vector Anopheles melas.
The Slotman lab is interested in the evolutionary ge-
netics of malaria mosquitoes, with an emphasis on
the Anopheles gambiae complex. Anopheles melas is
a saltwater-breeding member of this complex with a
patchy distribution along the West Coast of Africa,
stretching from Senegal to Angola. This species is a
locally important vector on Bioko Island, Equatorial
Guinea, and other locations in West Africa. A thor-
ough understanding of the population structure and
migration pattern of An. melas will allow us to pre-
dict the risk and speed of migration from the African
mainland to Bioko Island, where an extensive malaria
control project has been underway. Additionally, the
potential for the spread of insecticide resistance, as well
as the eﬀect of habitat fragmentation on this species’
population structure are relevant issues.
The successful candidate will use microsatellite markers
and mtDNA to study the population structure of An.
melas across its distribution. This candidate should
have an interest in vector biology, and some background
in (evolutionary) genetics is preferred.

UDublin WillowVariation
PhD Graduate Position: Investigating variation of
disease resistance and wood formation genes in wil-
low (Teagasc Walsh Fellowship, 3 years, University of
Dublin, Trinity College, Ireland)
Willows (Salix) are important economically and eco-
logically. They are a renewable energy source that
when grown as an energy crop can mitigate CO2 emis-
sions. There is increased interest in the use of willow
as a source of biomass on Irish farms and production
is now grant aided. It is desirable to have varieties
with an increased dry matter content and wood den-
sity, which would decrease the drying costs and increase
the caloriﬁc value of the wood. It is also desirable to
improve their resistance to biotic agents such as fungal
diseases and insect pests. Wild willows in Ireland are
well adapted over many generations but their genetic
diversity is unknown.
The proposal aims to characterise native species of wil-
low through DNA sequencing to assess the levels and
the nature of natural polymorphism within the species
and populations studied. Importantly, they will be as-
sessed for variation in speciﬁc genes known to confer tol-
erance to biotic agents (fungi and pests) as well as genes
that aﬀect dry matter and wood density. Eﬀorts will
concentrate on Salix viminalis since commercial vari-
eties are available for this species. Willows and poplars
(Populus) are closely related (Salicaceae family). Sev-
eral important genes aﬀecting disease resistance and
wood formation are well characterized in poplar and
will have homologs in willow. We propose to exam-
ine these genes in native willows and compare them to
commercial cultivars. Material showing greater gene
diversity for a target region such as disease resistance
will identify germplasm with potential value for further
breeding work.July 1, 2009 EvolDir 21
The project is a collaboration between Trinity Col-
lege Dublin (TCD), Teagasc and the National Botanic
Gardens Glasnevin. It will be jointly supervised by
Dr Trevor Hodkinson (TCD; www.tcd.ie/Botany/ ), Dr
Gerry Douglas (Teagasc (Kinsealy; www.teagasc.ie )
and Dr Colin Kelleher (www.botanicgardens.ie). The
researcher will be based at all three institutions. The
student will receive an annual tax free stipend of 21,000
Euro for maintenance and to cover university fees. Fees
are approximately 5,500 Euro for EU students or 12,000
Euro for non-EU students. There will be opportunities
to make more money teaching and demonstrating on
undergraduate courses and invigilating examinations.
The ideal candidate will have experience of bioinfor-
matic methods and wet lab experience of PCR and se-
quencing. They should have an interest in population
genetics and evolutionary genetics. Applicants must
have a ﬁrst or second class (preferably upper) Bache-
lors, or Masters, degree in a biological science or rele-
vant subject. To apply or to obtain further information,
please send a CV, contact details of two referees and a

UNeuchatel SocialEvolutionTheory
Dear colleagues,
Two PhD positions are open under the supervi-
sion of Dr. Laurent Lehmann to study social evo-
lution theory at the Laboratory of eco- ethology
of the University of Neuchatel Switzerland ( http://-
www2.unine.ch/ethol/). The positions are funded by
the Swiss National Science Foundation and are available
for three years. Starting date: end of 2009, beginningJuly 1, 2009 EvolDir 23
of 2010. Salary per annum: 36900 to 45600 CHF.
The focus of the SNF-funded project is to develop gene-
culture co- evolutionary models for social interactions,
with focus on human evolution. The project will have
two diﬀerent but complementary directions. First, we
will seek to develop models, which can explain the evo-
lution of the transition of small-scale egalitarian soci-
eties to larger-scale stratiﬁed societies. Second, we will
seek to develop models aiming at understanding the
role of individual and social learning in the expression
and dynamics of social behaviours, for example in the
context of the usage of adaptive and maladaptive cul-
tural traits. Some related papers on this can be found
athttp:// www.stanford.edu/ ˜ lehmann/ . Depending
upon the applicants, the work could be taken in a num-
ber of directions.
The Institute of Biology at Neuchatel consists of a
dozen groups working in diverse ﬁelds of ecology,
evolution, physiology and molecular and cell biology.
Neuchatel is a University town in the French-speaking
part of Switzerland situated between the Jura Moun-
tains and a 40km long lake. The town is well connected
with larger centers such as Lausanne, Geneva, Berne, or
Zurich by public transportation. For more information,
contact Laurent Lehmann (lehmann@stanford.edu).
Applicants must have a university degree that allows
entrance to a PhD program. Applicants are required to
have good knowledge in mathematics or computer pro-
gramming. Ideal applicants have a good knowledge of
evolutionary biology, behavioural ecology and/or pop-
ulation genetics. A strong interest in understanding
the genetic and cultural factors driving social evolution
in humans is an asset. Motivated applicants should
submit (1) a one-page letter that summarizes interests
and relevant experience, (2) a CV, (3) copies of un-
dergraduate and masters/diploma transcripts, and (4)
contact information for 2 references (all as PDFs) to
lehmann@stanford.edu.

PhD student position, University of New Brunwick:
Plant traits and insect host-race formation
A fully funded position is available for a PhD studentat the University of New Brunswick, Fredericton (lab-
oratory of Dr. Steve Heard), starting in fall 2009 or
winter 2010.
The research project involves the study of variation in
plant traits, within species and between closely related
species, and how they interact with insect preferences
to shape the evolution of diet in insect herbivores. We
will be particularly interested in trait distributions and
preferences that favour the evolution of diet generalism
(one insect feeds on several host plants) vs. divergence
with the evolution of diet specialization (leading to evo-
lution of a host-race complex with each race feeding on
a single host plant). Our model system is the diverse
community of insects feeding on the common golden-
rods Solidago altissima and Solidago gigantea. The
project will involve both ﬁeld and laboratory work.

ParasiteEvolution
POST-GRADUATE PHD POSITION IN THE EM-
BLEY/HIRT GROUP, NEWCASTLE UNIVERSITY,
UK
A PhD position is available in our group to work on the
evolutionary biology of microsporidian parasites:
Microsporidia, opportunistic intracellular pathogens,
cause chronic diarrhoea in children and the elderly,
especially in the developing World and frequently in-
fect patients with HIV/AIDS. They are among the
simplest eukaryotic cells known, having lost many
metabolic pathways common to other eukaryotes and
have greatly simpliﬁed the structure and functions of24 EvolDir July 1, 2009
their organelles. As a consequence, Microsporidia are
ideal model systems for identifying the truly indispens-
able features of eukaryotic cells. Recent data from our
laboratory suggest that mitosomes, the basic mitochon-
dria found in Microsporidia, house enzymes that are vi-
tal for parasite survival (Nature, 452, 624-628; Nature
453, 553-556; Nature, 440: 623-630; Nature, 418: 865-
869). The aim of this project is to now fully determine
the essential function(s) of these minimal mitochondria.
The work has far reaching importance because: (i) it
will provide functional data for an organelle that is es-
sential for the survival of major human parasites and
(ii) it will challenge the long-held hypothesis that the
key function of mitochondria (deﬁned in the broadest
sense) in eukaryotic cells is to make ATP.
The successful candidate will join a research group
working at the forefront of international eﬀorts to un-
derstand the fundamental biology and evolution of Mi-
crosporidia and will play a major role in a multidis-
ciplinary international project with similar aims. You
will be trained in cell and molecular biology, and in
computational analysis, in a laboratory with a strong
interest in evolution (Nature, 440: 623-630). You will
also have opportunities to work in the laboratories of
our leading collaborators in Cambridge and Germany
(Nature, 452, 624-628; Nature 453, 553-556).
Person Speciﬁcation: You should have, or expect to
achieve, a ﬁrst class or upper-second class Honours de-
gree (or European equivalent) or a higher qualiﬁcation,
in a relevant subject.
Eligibility and Value of Award: This Studentship is
open to UK and other EU students who have a rele-
vant connection to the UK and meet the BBSRC1s el-
igibility criteria. The award will cover tuition fees and
an annual stipend (living allowance) at UK Research
Council rates (approximately £13,000 per annum).
Please pass this on to anyone you know who might be
interested, or to anyone who might be able to pass it
on further.

UOxford AntibioticEvolution
Ph.D Position, Experimental evolution of antibiotic re-
sistance, University of Oxford
Experimental evolution of antibiotic resistance
The evolution of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bac-
teria poses a fundamental threat to human, animal, and
plant health. Combinatorial drug therapies have been
widely advocated as a treatment strategy to prevent
resistance from evolving, but the fundamental ecolog-
ical and evolutionary processes involved in adaptation
to multi-drug environments remain poorly understood.
The goal of this project will be to address two funda-
mental questions using experimental evolution in the
opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aerugi-
nosa: i. Which combinations of antibiotics to use? Pop-
ulation genetic theory predicts that epistasis between
resistance mutations can constrain or promote the evo-
lution of multidrug resistance. We will test the ability
of metabolic control theory to predict patterns of epis-
tasis between antibiotics based on the functional inter-
actions between their cellular targets. This will involve
quantifying the ﬁtness costs of carrying combinations of
mutations giving resistance to diﬀerent antibiotics. ii.
How to deploy antibiotics? We will test ability of classi-
cal ecological models and novel optimal control models
to predict how environmental variation impacts the evo-
lution of resistance. This will involve manipulating the
spatial and temporal pattern of antibiotic deployment
during long-term experimental evolution of the oppor-
tunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa in
multidrug environments.

Medical science is typically pitted against the evolution-
ary forces acting upon infective populations of bacteria.
As an alternative strategy, our growing understanding
of population dynamics of social traits in bacteria could
be applied to revolutionize the treatment of bacterial
disease.
This project will test predictions about the ability of so-
cial cheats to invade populations of cooperative strains:
public good cheats, cheats carrying beneﬁcial alleles
(Trojan horses) and cheats carrying allelopathic traits
(anti-competitor chemical bacteriocins). Theory sug-
gests that exploitation of the invasive ability of cheats
is a potential new strategy for helping treat bacterial
disease (Brown, West, Diggle and Griﬃn (in press) Phil
Trans Roy Soc).
To further develop this idea the student will: a) test
relative competitive ability of diﬀerent kinds of so-
cial cheats by experiment in the bacteria Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, b) test the ability of strains that have been
engineered to carry medically beneﬁcial alleles to out-
compete wild-type strains. Speciﬁcally, we will use use
cheating strains carrying antibiotic sensitivity alleles
and/or a gene for the production of a lethal toxin (un-
der the control of an inducible promoter) which when26 EvolDir July 1, 2009
activated, would eliminate both cooperators and cheats.
c) compare antibiotic sensitivity of populations that
have been infected with Trojan horse antibiotic sen-
sitive strains, with those that have not.
The integration of theory and experiment is a key goal
of this project. The student will receive training in
mathematical modelling techniques with SB, and there
will be scope for involvement by the student in the con-
struction and analysis of further models inspired by ex-
perimental insights. Model development will include
extensions to the dynamical ecological models of thera-
putic cheat invasion and establishment (extending work
in Brown et al in Press), inclusive ﬁtness formalisms to
introduce longer-term evolutionary dynamics (e.g. so-
cial resistance evolution), and simulations (anchored on
the analytical results).

Project SEUILS : Modulation of individual behavioral
decisions in social contexts
Abstract Individual decision processes have often been
overlooked in insect societies. However, investigating
the mechanisms underlying these processes allows un-
derstanding how individuals adjust to their environ-
ment and thereby adaptively satisfy their needs and
the colonyˆ as. The theoretical framework of our project
derives from response-threshold models describing indi-
vidual decisions as 3-components processes: - Expres-
sion: What are the task-related signals? - Perception:
What sensory and cognitive processes allow the evalu-
ation of these signals? - Action: How is the decision
reached? Each phase will be investigated in three con-
texts reﬂecting social complexity: social recognition,
task allocation and worker reproductive decisions. We
will unravel the role of internal and external factors
on social insectsˆ a decisions in context. Social recog-
nition, the ﬁrst aspect, is based in insects on chemi-
cal signals. During encounters a phenotype-matching
process allows comparison between perceived cues and
an internal template acquired through an imprinting-
like process and/or self-reference mechanisms. The ac-
tual behavioural response (rejection or not) depends on
adaptive signiﬁcance of the discrimination. Interest-
ingly, adult social insects have also been proven able to
learn an enemy-speciﬁc template from an alien colony,July 1, 2009 EvolDir 27
leading to a modiﬁed level of aggression. We aim at (1)
characterising the template learning process in adults
and (2) elucidating the decisions rules after stimulus
assessment. We will assess the inﬂuence of bioamines
and nutritional status (1) on template learning and (2)
on the tolerance threshold value. Task allocation, the
second social situation, is characterised by specialisa-
tion and behavioural ﬂexibility which permit the work-
ers to respond to colony needs. Among others, lar-
vae may provide information on colony-level attributes
and work demands, and adjust individual choices and
task performances for both nursing and foraging. After
identiﬁcation of the larval signals, we will characterise
the associated response threshold for each age-related
task and analyse the eﬀect of individual internal state
on the response threshold. Worker reproductive deci-
sions are the third aspect of decision processes studies.
In most social insect species, the ability of workers to
lay male eggs creates a potential conﬂict between all
colony members for reproduction. The expression of
this conﬂict depends on costs and beneﬁts associated
to the decision of reproducing or not. A new strategy
has been discovered where workers parasitize conspe-
ciﬁc colonies. We will investigate the inﬂuence of var-
ious factors on the choices available to workers. These
choices are to work, to reproduce or to parasitize an-
other colony. Experimental designs will be developed
to allow detailed behavioural observations which will be
aided by path analyses and behaviour recording soft-
ware. Signals will be analysed through gas chromatog-
raphy. Extraction techniques will be developed to test
biological activity of signals and to manipulate them,
for example by creating fractions or mixed chemical sig-
nals to be used in bioassays. We will focus on the inﬂu-
ence of two factors on individual decisions in our three

THREE-YEAR PHD POSITION IN PLANT EVOLU-
TIONARY BIOLOGY
A Ph.D. position in Plant Evolutionary Biology is avail-
able at the Dept. of Organismic Biology, Division ofPlant Ecology & Diversity, University of Salzburg, Aus-
tria, with Prof. Hans Peter Comes and Dr. Gunter
Fischer to study the ecology and evolution of reproduc-
tive traits in the orchid genus Bulbophyllum from the
Southwest Indian Ocean region (Madagascar, Comoros,
Mascareignes)
This research project will involve reﬁned molecular-
phylogenetic (ITS, cpDNA, single/ low-copy nuclear
genes), morphological and pollination-experimental
studies in a previously identiﬁed clade comprising c.
26 species, mainly distributed in Madagascar, but
also occurring in the remote oceanic islands of La
R´ eunion/Mauritius (Mascareignes) and the Comoros,
and on the East African continent. These analyses will
then be complemented by reconstructions (optimiza-
tions) of ancestral reproductive/ﬂoral-characters, areas
and habitat preferences in conjunction with a molecular
dating approach using paleogeological and fossil-based
calibrations. Together, this will allow us to infer how
mating types (outcrossing vs. auto-pollination), and
associated ﬂoral traits, have changed within the clade
over evolutionary time and under which spatial, tem-
poral and ecological circumstances.
The ideal applicant has a strong interest in plant evolu-
tion and a strong background in plant molecular phylo-
genetics, pollination experimental work, and statistical
analyses. As extensive ﬁeldwork in remote places of
Madagascar is required, the successful candidate must
also have a strong physical ﬁtness and experience in
conducting ﬁeldwork under tropical rainforest condi-
tions. A MSc, diploma degree or equivalent in Botany,
Ecology, Genetics or Evolutionary Biology is required.
Fluent English is a must and French as second language
would be an advantage.
Funding is for three years by the Austrian National Sci-
ence Fund (FWF). The University of Salzburg ( http:/-

very pleasant working and living environment in one of
the most beautiful landscapes in Austria.

MurreletGeneticVariation
MSc position available studying adaptive genetic vari-
ation in Marbled Murrelets
I am seeking an outstanding MSc student in the ﬁeld
of conservation genetics in the Department of Forest
and Wildlife Ecology at the University of Wisconsin-
Madison. Current research in my lab focuses on char-
acterizing demographic history and understanding the
eﬀects of habitat fragmentation on the microevolu-
tion of threatened species. In doing so, we typically
integrate ﬁeld, genetic, and population modeling ap-proaches to identify factors limiting populations, un-
derstand/predict the genetic and demographic conse-
quences of limiting factors, and provide managers and
policy makers with the information needed to make in-
formed management decisions.
The students thesis will involve characterizing adap-
tive genetic variation in the Marbled Murrelet, speciﬁ-
cally at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).
The Marbled Murrelet is a federally threatened seabird
that nests primarily in coastal old-growth forests along
the west coast of North America. Fragmentation of
old-growth forests and increasing predator populations
have resulted in a number of geographically isolated and
declining populations. Previous work based on neu-
tral (microsatellite) genetic markers has detected little
genetic variation across the species range. Adaptive
markers, such as MHC, that are under the inﬂuence of
natural selection may yield ﬁner-scale among popula-
tion diﬀerentiation and have implications for the cur-
rent proposal to remove murrelets from the threatened
species list. Samples have already been collected and
this will primarily be a lab-based project, although op-
portunities to do ﬁeld work may develop. This work will
be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Vicki Friesen
at Queens University. Applicants should possess a
B.Sc. in Conservation Biology or closely related ﬁeld
and have a strong background in molecular laboratory
techniques, particularly bacterial cloning and DNA se-
quencing. Funding is in place for two years of graduate
student support ($19,000/year + tuition waiver) and

Two PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR POSITIONS
(Yan2 Jiu1 Yuan2) in ecology, conservation biology, and
evolution, at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, based
at the Kunming Institute of Zoology (KIZ), Kunming,
China.
The Ecology, Conservation, and Environment Cen-34 EvolDir July 1, 2009
ter (ECEC) at KIZ ( www.kiz.ac.cn , English version,
ECEC website) invites applications for two full- time
PI positions in ecology and evolution, broadly deﬁned.
The rank is equivalent to an Assistant or Associate Pro-
fessor in the US. Senior applicants (those with faculty
positions) will also be considered and are eligible for
special recruitment packages from the national govern-
ment.
The ECEC was recently established as a joint center
between the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Uni-
versity of East Anglia (UK). The ECEC’s mission is to
conduct international-quality research in ecology and
conservation biology, to train Chinese and foreign Ph.D.
and postdoctoral researchers, to lead the development
of ecology and conservation science in China and South-
east Asia, and to provide information necessary for en-
vironmental policy-making. The KIZ is one of China’s
leading scientiﬁc research institutes for evolutionary bi-
ology, its faculty are internationally recognized, and the
institute is building an ecology and conservation group
on this foundation.
This is a superb opportunity to pursue an independent
research program, backed by a large research team and
ample funding. Highly qualiﬁed candidates conducting
research on any taxa and in all areas of ecology, evo-
lution, and conservation biology are encouraged to ap-
ply. We especially encourage applicants with research
programs involving molecular ecology and bioinformat-
ics, theory and modeling, conservation planning and
economics, and/or climate change. Responsibilities in-
clude contributing to the ECEC’s mission, obtaining
external funding, and publication in top, international
journals.
Considerable startup funding is available, generally at
levels higher than those oﬀered by European or US uni-
versities, and faculty will be members of the KIZ’s State
Key Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Evolution,
led by the director of the KIZ, Prof. Zhang Ya-Ping.
Facilities at the KIZ include 454 next-gen sequencing,
SNP, and gene- chip facilities in a new, national bar-
coding center to be installed this year, extensive in-
ternet journal access, a zoological museum with over
600,000 specimens, and access to CAS ﬁeld stations,
datasets, and facilities around the country. In addition
to opportunities for collaboration within the ECEC and
KIZ, there are ample local opportunities for collabora-
tion with ecologists and evolutionary biologists at the
Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden (xtbg.ac.cn
&www.ecologicalevolution.org ) and the Kunming In-
stitute of Botany ( www.kib.ac.cn ), as well as local uni-
versities. In the near future, faculty from the three
institutes, including the ECEC, will be combined to es-
tablish a new National Laboratory in Biodiversity inSouthwest China.
The working languages at the KIZ are Chinese and En-
glish. All nationalities are welcome to apply, and most
faculty have had international research experience. It is
possible to conduct research outside China with grant
monies from China. There is no undergraduate teach-
ing. Starting date is ﬂexible.
Candidates with a strong record of accomplishment (a
Ph.D., postdoctoral experience, and published papers
in SCI journals) should submit a CV, a statement of
research interests and plans, and pdfs of three pub-
lications. Please also include the names, addresses,
and contact details of three individuals who can pro-
vide letters of recommendation. A single, combined
PDF or zipped ﬁle is preferred and can be emailed
to<ECEC.KIZ@gmail.com >. Informal enquiries can
be made with the center’s director, Dr. Douglas Yu
<dougwyu@gmail.com >.
Applications will be reviewed starting 31 July 2009 un-
til the positions are ﬁlled. This advert will be repeated
over the next months.

Research Technician Two year ﬁxed term contract
Starting Salary £22,525 (including London weighting)
JOB DESCRIPTION
One of the most fascinating aspects of host-parasite in-
teractions is how behaviour can change when an animal
becomes host to a parasite. Often these behavioural
changes are purely pathological, but in many cases
they appear to have an adaptive function, enhancing
the evolutionary ﬁtness of either the host or the para-
site. Most attention from biologists interested in this
subject has focussed on those cases where behavioural
changes in the host appear to arise from manipulation
of the host by the parasite in order to increase par-
asite ﬁtness. Rather less attention has been paid to
those behavioural changes that enhance host ﬁtness af-
ter infection, but a number of behavioural changes post-
infection are now known that can be explained in this
way. The two that are best described and most rel-
evant here are terminal investment, when an animal

tempt to compensate for lost future reproduction, and
behavioural fever, which occurs when an ectothermicorganism seeks out hot places in order to increase its
own body temperature in order to increase the eﬀec-
tiveness of its immune response.
Arguably the most iconic UK organism used for
the study of sexual selection, the yellow dung ﬂy,
Scathophaga stercoraria has been widely studied since
it inspired Parker to develop the paradigm of sperm
competition. Easily observed in the ﬁeld and simple
to culture on the laboratory, the sheer wealth of in-
formation regarding how selection inﬂuences the re-
productive biology of yellow dung ﬂies is unrivalled.
Scathophaga stercoraria is frequently infected with en-
tomopathogenic fungal parasites. The fungus kills the
host and then releases infectious conidia from the ca-
daver, and it appears to change the perching behaviour
of infected ﬂies in a number of ways before they die
in order to increase the probability of its conidia con-
tacting new hosts. Currently no data exist on ﬂy be-
haviour post-infection but before the ﬂy becomes mori-
bund. Flies could very well exhibit a variety of diﬀerent
behaviours, with variable eﬀects on their own ﬁtness
and on parasite ﬁtness.
We have been awarded two years of funding to ad-
dress this lack of knowledge and to determine if yel-
low dung ﬂies exhibit either terminal investment, be-
havioural fever, or both. The project will involve estab-
lishing baseline data on disease progression and, using
this information, performing a variety of experiments
to assess changes in sex-speciﬁc behaviours and repro-
ductive investment after infection has occurred. We
seek a self-motivated candidate with a strong interest
in evolutionary biology, speciﬁcally sexual selection and
host/parasite interactions, and experimental biology to
ﬁll a two year research technician post.
Job Speciﬁcation
The successful candidate will provide evidence of the
following essential skills: - A BSc focussed on evolu-
tionary biology, with special interest in sexual selec-
tion, parasitology, entomology or a related subject, -
The ability to work well in large institution with peo-
ple from diverse backgrounds Additional skills: - Ex-
perience with experimental insect systems, including

DNA recleaning methodsJuly 1, 2009 EvolDir 45
Dear all,
I am having trouble getting PCR ampliﬁcations from
some of my samples. I have not access to more tis-
sue sample, so I have tried re-cleaning the genomic
DNA in solution using diﬀerent methods with *very*
little success, usually losing much of the DNA in the
process. I’ve tried: - Phenol-chlorophorm-isoamyl +
chlorophorm-isoamyl + ethanol precipitation; - Heat-
ing them in NaOH+SDS for 20 minutes (following Shi
et al. 2004) followed by Phenol-chlorophorm-isoamyl
+ ethanol precipitation; - Promega Wizard Genomic
DNA Puriﬁcation kit; - Qiagen DNeasy Tissue kit; -
Qiagen DNeasy Plant kit. I have plenty, long non-
degraded DNA in solution (checked on Nanodrop and
on agarose gel). I’ve also tried diluting the samples
with no success. When co-amplifying these samples
with ones that work, I still get ampliﬁcations (that se-
quence well) which means whatever it is, it’s not some-
thing in solution but most likely bound/cross-linked to
the DNA. I must add that these samples were originally
extracted from ﬁsh muscle tissue preserved in ethanol
or frozen, using an ammonium acetate protocol and iso-
propanol precipitation. I’d be grateful if you could sug-
gest some alternative method that has worked for you,
including modiﬁcations of the above (as they are typ-
ically meant for extraction from tissue and not from
aqueous solution). Thanks! Hugo

Evolution toys
I am writing to let the scientiﬁc and educational
communities know about a new toy company ded-
icated to teaching younger kids about evolution,
www.charliesplayhouse.com (“Games and Toys In-
spired by Darwin”). The ﬁrst toy is an 18-foot long
timeline that introduces kids to over 60 amazing crea-
tures that have sprouted up in the last 600 million
years.
The company was founded because there are literally no
toys out there focusing on evolution even though the
market is replete with toys about chemistry, physics,
astronomy, and virtually any other branch of science.
The big toy companies also shy away from the subject
because of fears of a political backlash from creationists.
Please help me spread the word about this company.
It’s not easy to be starting a company right now, but
it’s especially hard when so many educators and par-
ents think evolution is a subject little kids can’t handle.
Of course, it is, and this company even makes it fun.

Foundations of Evolutionary Biology
Dear colleagues,
In my courses I’ve often used the series by University
Of Chicago Press on classic papers in diﬀerent areas
(“Foundations of Ecology”, “Foundation of Biogeogra-
phy” and “Foundations of Animal Behavior”). I always
wondered why don’t we have a similar series on Evo-
lutionary Biology, given that I think it’d be a great
teaching tool.
So I decided to contact you and ask for what you think
would be the most inﬂuential papers in the ﬁeld of Evo-
lutionary Biology. I’ll compile the list, rank the papers
and provide the list back to Evoldir.
Looking forward to your contribution,

Hong Kong Teaching Petition
Dear Scientists:
The Hong Kong Education Bureau recently issued a
new biology syllabus guideline containing the following
statement concerning teaching evolution: “In addition
to Darwin’s theory, students are encouraged to explore
other explanations for evolution and the origins of life,
to help illustrate the dynamic nature of scientiﬁc knowl-
edge”.
This statement will open the door for teaching cre-
ationism or intelligent design in biology class as “al-
ternative” to the theory of evolution. The South China
Morning Post, a leading Hong Kong newspaper, has re-
ported that many Hong Kong middle schools and sec-
ondary schools will teach creationism or intelligent de-
sign. Some school principals also said they support the
idea of teaching creationism/intelligent design as “al-July 1, 2009 EvolDir 47
ternative” to evolution in biology class.
So far, the Education Bureau refuses to review its
guidance statement regarding teaching evolution. A
letter of support dated May 5, 2009 and signed by
62 people (including principals of schools, teachers,
professors, and scientists; among them is a known In-
telligent Design advocate) has been submitted to Hong
Kong Education Panel of Legislative Council, claiming
that there is no problem with the wording in the
current biology curriculum guidelines. The arguments
presented in the letter are mostly distortions and mis-
understandings of evolution. The letter uses the List of
Signers from the Scientiﬁc Dissent From Darwinism as
evidence of scientiﬁc authority supporting “alternative
explanations to Darwinian macro-evolution”, saying
that “a growing list of over 750 highly qualiﬁed scien-
tists, many from some of the world’s most respected
academic institutions, have signed a statement which
says: ”We are skeptical of claims for the ability of
random mutation and natural selection to account
for the complexity of life. Careful examination
of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be
encouraged“. [ http://www.dissentfromdarwin.org/-
index.php]” A petition is currently being organized by
the Concern Group for Hong Kong Science Education
[https://sites.google.com/site/hkscienceeducation/-
petition-statement], asking the Education Bureau to
clarify the problematic statement in the upcoming
Biology Curriculum for Hong Kong secondary schools.
The website http://www.gopetition.com/online/-
28149.html has more background details. The site
contains both Chinese and English versions of the
petition. [Sign the Petition] box is located at the
bottom of the English version.
Your signature support is very importantfor promot-
ing evolution education in Hong Kong and prevent-
ing creationists from taking over Hong Kong secondary
schools.
Please help me forward this email to your fellow sci-
entists for their attention. Thepetition signing is open
until6/30/2009.

Dear Evoldir members,
We are working with Juniperus cedrus (crupessaceae)
in population genetics. We have tried to extract DNA
from seed (endocarp tissue) using diﬀerent protocols
and commercials kits. However, we haven’t obtain
DNA enough . Juniperus seeds are small and very hard.
So, there are anybody that have extracted DNA from
similar seeds or woody tissues successfully?
Thank in advance,
Beatriz Rumeu I have received many suggestions that
are showed below:
1) I have done quite a bit of work on seeds. With re-
gards to breaking them up...have you though about just
encasing the seed in a couple of layers of tin foil, then
giving them a damn good whack with a hammer? Basi-
cally ﬂatten them. Then dump them in a tube. Works
great on many seeds in my hands, although I haven’t
tried juniper.
2) It took one year till I got DNA from Juniperus com-
munis embryos. It was a hard time, but at the end I
succeeded. I used hundreds of extraction protocols but
only the Nucleon PhytoPure from Amersham worked.
To grind the tissue, I used a Retsch mill. That was all.
3) I have extracted from woody tissues from Quercus
and also from avellana seeds. I always get good results
with the qiagen kit Dneasy Plant, but, for PCR, most of
the times I worked with only the second elution because
the ﬁrst one got probably more inhibitors of PCR or re-
striction enzymatic reactions....have you tried a second
elution of the column??? Also, for very hard materials
I had to use less quantity of material that the one the
kit recommends...
4) I extracted DNA from Arabidopsis seeds, which are
also very small, and fairly hard, especially when frozen.
I froze the seeds in liquid nitrogen and ground them in
a bead beater (genogrinder 2000). I think I extracted
with Qiagen DNeasy Plant. You might want to reduce
the amount of elution buﬀer used in the last step. I
think they also have a micro kit, or you could try the
puregene kit. Because the seeds are so small, they don’t
have much DNA. I had to bulk at least 10 seeds to get
enough DNA to detect. However, it should be possible
to amplify DNA from a single seed,even if you don’t48 EvolDir July 1, 2009
have very much DNA, as long as the fragment you are
amplifying is short and the PCR reaction is robust.
5)I have worked with seeds, mostly old and degraded
seeds but here are some suggestions. Have you ground
them up? This is hard with some of the seeds I have
worked with but critical to extracting the DNA. We
use a mixer mill to grind them up and get a very ﬁne
powder. I know some colleagues who use mortar and
pestles with liquid nitrogen, other use pliers cover with
plastic to protect from contamination.
The problems we have found is inhibition from;
Phenolics - we remove by precipitating with PVP.
Starch - we remove by treatment with amylase
Humic substances - we remove through chromatogra-
phy columns
We have extracted with enzymatic extraction meth-
ods (proteinase K), and chemical methods (CTAB,
GuSCN) and had success with all of these methods.
6)Seg ˜Ao¯n mi experiencia con endocarpos de distintas
especies, creo que la cantidad de ADN obtenida de un
endocarpo depende (adem ˜As del peso de partida, cal-
idad de muestra, protocolo...) del homogeneizado de
˜Ac/circlecopyrtste. Hay que procurar obtener una pulverizaci ˜A3n
total, y para ello necesitas Nitr ˜A3geno l ˜A’quido, bo-
las (5 mm di ˜Ametro) de acero o carburo de tungsteno
y un mixer mill (homogeneizador vibratorio). Es lo
m˜As eﬁcaz. Si no lo consigues por la dureza del endo-
carpo, prueba troze ˜Andolo con unos alicates antes de
molerlo. Los Kits dan menos rendimiento pero ganas
en “limpieza” y eso mejora la ampliﬁcaci ˜A3n posterior.
Un protocolo basado en CTAB suele funcionar. En este

Merging MrBayes ﬁles
Dear Evoldir Members, I have been trying to merge
both log and tree ﬁles from a few runs of MrBayes. I
did it in the past in LogCombiner from Beast package,
but once I’ve changed a computer it seems that some
regional settings make the tree ﬁles illegible to the pro-
gram. I’ve been trying to change those settings (which
worked perfectly in my previous computer) but now I’m
constantly getting following error message:July 1, 2009 EvolDir 49
Exception: 1 java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException:
1 at dr.app.tools.LogCombiner. <init>(Unknown
Source) at dr.app.tools.LogCombiner.main(Unknown
Source)
Does anyone have a good solution to this problem?
Maybe another program?
We (Polish) have been on the wrong side of iron cur-
tain, when the fundamentals of computer systems were
set.
Many people here would be very grateful if authors of
computer programs would keep that fact in mind ;)

Micro interpretation
Dear Evoldir,
We would like to draw on your knowledge on microsatel-
lite marker interpretation, as we have some results for
the freshwater diatom Asterionella formosa that we cannot quite satisfactorily explain.
We did a preliminary screen of the Asterionella pop-
ulation in Lake Maarsseveen (Netherlands) using ten
newly developed microsatellite markers on nine diﬀer-
ent isolates. The result showed that i) all nine tested
isolates showed the same genotype and that ii) all ten
tested loci were 100% heterozygous. Although diatoms
are assumed to reproduce mainly asexually, this uni-
formity in the population and the extremely high het-
erozygote percentage seems a rather farfetched out-
come.
Further this result also astonished us, as we have AFLP,
allozyme and experimental data that did show high ge-
netic polymorphism in Asterionella isolates from the
same population. AFLP analysis using four primer
combinations produced 116 markers of which 72% were
polymorphic. Allozyme analysis using three enzymes
yielded one monomorphic and two polymorphic en-
zymes and showed three genotypes in 24 Asterionella
isolates. Heterozygosity was estimated at 51.2% based
on the two polymorphic enzymes. And last, a reac-
tion norms experiment on the response of seven Asteri-
onella isolates to ﬁve diﬀerent temperatures showed sig-
niﬁcant isolate by temperature interactions. All these
data strongly suggest genetic variation in the Asteri-
onella population in Lake Maarsseveen.
So we are at loss as to how to interpret the results ob-
tained by the ten microsatellite markers and would be
very glad about any ideas or suggestions.

Microsatellite cloned sequences
Dear Evoldir member,
We are working with microsatellite in a plant species.
We have found a peak proﬁle that correspond with a
triploid species. So, in order to determinate if each peak
correspond with a true allele, we have cloned and se-
quenced PCR product. We have found more than two
alleles for the same individual, in fact we have found
four and ﬁve alleles in the same individual. The bp
distance between the true peaks correspond with the
bp distance detected between some sequences. On the
other hand, the distance between the true alleles and
its respective slippage, correspond with the distance in50 EvolDir July 1, 2009
bp recorded between some sequences. So, could we con-
ﬁrmed the ploidy status (triploid) of this plants in base
to these cloned sequences?
Thank in advance,

Microsats Stained with EtBr
Dear Colleagues,
I am seeking a low-cost, in-house alternative to sending
out microsatellite DNA for genotyping in a capillary
array using ﬂuorescent-labelled primers. Ideally, this
would be a system that could be handled by under-
graduates (including the attendant error rates, safety
concerns, and low-technical skills).
I have found some methods from the Ag-science litera-
ture that describe a system for staining acrylamide gels
using ethidium bromide and visualized using a standard
UV-light transilluminator -
http://crop.scijournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/43/-
5/1828 The entire system seems to be commercially
available as a custom electrophoresis rig and slab-gel
glass plates. This looks like it could be fairly easy, and
at~$2000 for the gel set-up, the price is right. How-
ever, my experience with acrylamide is not something
I look back on fondly, and I always prefer non-toxic
alternatives when possible.
Has anyone used this system, or something like it? Is
the low, low cost worth the predictable hassle?

Chris Smith <csmith@willamette.edu >Microsats stained with EtBr answers
Dear Colleagues,
Thanks to the many, many people who replied to my
query about using acrylamide and EtBR as an alter-
native to modern capillary arrays. I apologize for not
replying to each of you individually; the number of re-
sponses and requests for copies of the answers necessi-
tate a mass- mailing.
It seems that most everyone agrees that analysis in a
capillary array using ﬂuorescent-labelled primers is al-
ways preferable. However, a number of you suggested
alternatives. The most popular were silver- staining
of acrylamide gels, and the Elchrom Scientiﬁc ’origins’
system. My current plan is to try out demo-models of
each of these before making a ﬁnal purchase.
Below, I have posted the responses I received, with
identifying information removed out of respect for our
colleagues’ privacy, If you would like to write directly
to any of the respondents, please let me know and I will
pass along their contact information.
Best regards, and thanks to all,
Chris.

Elchrom (Switzerland) used to make a system with hor-
izontal agarose gels that may help.
But I think that nothing beats labelled primers and
sizing on sequencer.
Dear Chris,
I have been using for this purpose precast gels from
Elchrom scientiﬁc, which also ship a electrophoresis ap-
paratus. This is in a reasonalbe prize range and staining
is easy with Sybergold (or if you want with EtBr). I
prefer the Syber as it is more sensitive.
You can check out details on http://-
www.elchrom.com/ Cheers

Hi Chris,
I don’t know anything about the methods you’ve asked
about. But I just wanted to say that genotyping in core
facilities using capillary machines isn’t expensive. You
probably know this already, but here in PA we do multi-
plex PCRs and send them to Penn state for about $200
for a 96 well plate. Total cost per locus per individual
can be as low as abou $0.50. This is a great and worthy
price, given the complication of any alternatives.
Best,
—-
hey there, no reason this shouldn’t work. you previous
experience with acrylamide was tainted by getting the
toxic powder into solution, at the right concentration,
etc. There are premade solutions available now, so the
“toxicity” and diﬃculty is signiﬁcantly reduced.
check out biorad, I think they were the ones making
this stuﬀ.
best of luck

Dear Cris,
Just thought I would let you know I have used agarose
gels to visualize microsat variation and staining them
with EtBr. We used 3 or 5 % agarose gels (which you
need to play with to get it right, and must have a de-
gassing step to get rid of many trapped bubbles). We
were quite happy with the results. However, I must
qualify that we picked and choose microsats where the
diﬀerence in sizes between the alleles were larger than
15 bp, and we were scoring progeny from a F2 cross
(only two alelles present). I don’t think it works as well
if you have more than 3 alleles segregating, since you
may only see a blur.
Best wishes,
—-
Dear Chris, There is a system from Elchrom Scientiﬁc.
The gels are stained with Sybr Gold, it works good but:
only 2bp diﬀerences can be detected unambigously, you
can do max. 3 loci at once if you have approx. 100bp
diﬀerence. I have used it some years ago, if you do e.g.
paternity analysis using only a few microsatellite loci
(3-4) it is ok otherwisse you have to run many many
gels and the gels are plus minus expensive. Anyway
it is very easy and undergrads could easily handle it,
you only need a good geldoc sytem for detection of al-
leles.The best: you don?t have to produce gels, you
can just buy them and you don?t need ﬂourescent la-belling of primers. Just visit their home page ( http://-
www.elchrom.com/public/index.php ) there is informa-
tion available and you can ask me for more information.
I must say I have a ABI sequencer now and do not use
the Elchrom apparatus any more... hope to have helped
you. cheers,
—-
Dear Christopher
Such staining methods are diﬃcult because if running
denaturing gels the 2 DNA strands run diﬀerently and
there are 2 bands for each allele. If you do non de-
naturing you get heteroduplex bands as well making
it diﬃcult to interpret. I tried the later many years
ago with silver staining, colleagues tried silver staining
denaturing gels and blotting and probing with biotin
labelled probes and gave up for research purposes.
Good luck

tion on null alleles estimates. As required by many of
you, below are the answers I have received, together
with those of Mike Ritchie, whom had had a similar
question and kindly sent to me the answers he has got.
I hope it helps, Best wishes Carolina
Original post:
Dear all,
There are currently several methodologies available to
estimate null allele frequencies (and evidence for) when
working with microsatellite data. My question is: what
is the best method to use? If anyone can shed me a light
into it, I ˆAll appreciate it.
Thank you very much, Sincerely, CarolinaCarolina I. Mi ˜A±o, MSc.
ANSWERS I GET
The routine method is the maximum likelihood method
with the EM algorithm. You can use the likelihood ra-
tio test or information theoretic indices for statistical
support.

Hola Carolina,
I imagine you will receive many replies to your question,
as you are correct! There are many methods available
to estimate the suspected null allele frequencies. How-
ever, perhaps this paper is of interest? We published a
paper a few years ago estimating null alleles and mu-
tations as I was dealing with real cases of erroneous
estimates of illegitimate oﬀspring in a seabird species
we were studying. Perhaps it is useful if you are trying
to determine what the case is for speciﬁc individuals
if you are working on parentage studies. (A formula
example is given in the paper. There is a small typo
on pg. 213 where it says ’The probability of randomly
sampling from the same breeding site a chick and a male
that appear by chance to be related was calculated as
1 in216,000 or less’ which should read’was calculated
as 1 in 11111 or less’ which corresponds to dividing 1
into the more conservative probability given above in
the same paragraph, 9.0 x 10-5).
Best wishes, Gabriela Ibarguchi
MIKE RITCHIEˆ aS ANSWERS
Good news on null alleles.
Very many thanks to all those who replied to my query
about null alleles and population structure. I had
around 50 answers, which is testament to the extent
of the problem.July 1, 2009 EvolDir 53
Shortly before my submission Chapuis & Estoup pub-
lished a simulation of the eﬀects of various ways of esti-
mating the frequency of ˆ atheˆ a null allele and adjusting
Fst estimates. They have also developed software to do
this, which will surely become an essential resource:
Chapuis & Estoup 2007. Microsatellite null alleles and
estimation of population diﬀerentiation. Mol. Biol.
Evol. 24: 621-631.
http://www.montpellier.inra.fr/URLB/
Van Oosterhoutˆ as MICROCHECKER (the current ver-
sion is a major update from the last time I looked)
applies one of these and is available here: http://-
www.microchecker.hull.ac.uk/ van Oosterhout, C., D.
Weetman, and W. F. Hutchinson. 2006. Estimation
and adjustment of microsatellite null alleles in nonequi-
librium populations. Mol Ecol Notes 6:255-256.
So, if you are prepared to live with the assumptions of
these (the main ones being that your problem is due
to a single null, and no Wahlund eﬀects) there is great
scope for Fst-style analyses.
A nice surprise to me is that an imminent release of
STRUCTURE allows treating loci as dominant markers
so allowing analyses of potential sub-structure despite
nulls. This is not available yet, but is to be released
soon on the STRUCTURE website and Daniel Falush
and colleagues have a paper just out in MEN on this.

Prokaryotic Diversity Database
We are pleased to announce the availability of envDB, a
database that aims to provide the most complete census
to-date of the environmental distribution of prokary-
otes.
EnvDB connects the environmental characterization of
their original samples with the taxonomic identiﬁcation
of 16S rDNA sequences. This is the result of a compre-
hensive eﬀort to annotate all samplings and sequences
stored in the ENV section of GenBank database. Cur-54 EvolDir July 1, 2009
rently, envDB contains 359.928 sequences belonging to
3.502 samples, classiﬁed in 46 diﬀerent environmental
categories and some environmental features.
The user can perform complex queries using all pos-
sible combinations of sequences, OTUs, samples and
environments, using a user-friendly web interface. The
users can also analyze their own data: Given a set of
16S rDNA sequences input by the user, envDB checks
for similar sequences and samples in the database.The
results include also the environmental distribution of
the samples and sequences found.
Examples of questions that envDB can address include:
Obtaining all the sequences deposited for a particular
taxa; Retrieving all samples and associated sequences
for one environment; Finding all taxa present in a given
environment; or obtaining the abundance of taxa in en-
vironments.
EnvDB is freely accessible at the web address http:/-
/metagenomics.uv.es/envDB . A paper providing a full
description of envDB has been already published: Pig-

Renaturing Proteins IEF
Dear EvolDirers,
I am trying to adapt immobilized pH gradient (IPG)
strips with a basic narrow range (pH 7-10) to screen
for presence and activity of S-RNases in Solanum. The
problem is that the rehydration and sample preparation
buﬀers that the BioRad Protean cells require cause pro-
tein denaturing, hence forbidding me from running the
RNase activity test. I read somewhere that one can suc-
cessfully renature the proteins in the IPG strips by rins-
ing the strip in a particular buﬀer after the IEF is done
and directly test for RNAse activity in the strip, but I
can’t seem to ﬁnd speciﬁc instructions anywhere. Has
anyone done this renaturing and testing in these kind
of strips? If so, could you share your protocols/recipes?
Any insight will be greatly appreciated

SAMPL-method
Dear EvolDir community,
we are planning some population genetics with sev-
eral plant species of which no microsatellites are cur-
rently available. We therefore were seeking for alterna-
tives and stumbled across a new method with is called
SAMPL (selective ampliﬁcation of microsatellite poly-
morphic loci). This method allegedly combines the ad-
vantages of microsatellites with that of AFLP. How-
ever, only few studies have used this method so far,
which makes it somehow suspicious. So we would like to
know if somebody already has some experiences which
this method, if it lives up to its promise and if there are
some problems or diﬃculties one should know about.
Thanks in advance for any suggestions!

Software Crux 1 1 0
Crux is a recently developed software toolkit for phy-
logenetic inference that runs on Linux, FreeBSD, and
Mac OS X. It is structured as a set of Python modules
that exposes all the functionality necessary to conduct
sophisticated analyses, including:
* Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMCMC) estimation for a broad range of likelihood
models, including all specializations of GTR+I+G and
mixture models. The ’redpoint’ script directly supports
all common uses for the MCMCMC functionality.
Note that Crux can use pthreads to concurrently com-
pute tree likelihoods on multi-processor computers, as
well as MPI to concurrently run MCMC chains, so it is
practical to analyze data sets consisting of hundreds ofJuly 1, 2009 EvolDir 55
taxa and thousands of characters.
* Ubiquitous support for multifurcating trees.
* Sequence simulation under any of the models the like-
lihood engine is capable of.
* Neighbor joining (NJ) and relaxed neighbor join-
ing (RNJ) tree construction, the implementations of
which are extremely fast. Numerous corrected distance
computation methods are supported, including para-
linear/logDet. The ’MrRogers’ script directly supports
all common uses for the pairwise distance computation
and NJ/RNJ functionality.
* The ’crux’ script can be used interactively to browse
online documentation and prototype Crux scripts, or it
can be used to run scripts non-interactively.
All of Crux’s core functionality can be accessed via
Python and/or Cython, which makes it extremely ﬂexi-
ble as the basis for sophisticated scripts/programs that,
for example, require complete control of a capable like-
lihood computation engine.

and Protein models. While those actually execute 30-
50% slower than the standard double-precision imple-
mentations they can help to save almost 50% of memory
consumption on large alignments which is increasingly
becoming an issue. The numerical stability of the sin-
gle precision version needs further testing though, i.e.,
usage is currently only recommended when you run out
of memory.
- New -F option that stops ML searches under CAT or
GAMMA after the speciﬁed number of trees has been
computed without doing a more thorough search on the
best-scoring ﬁnal tree under GAMMA. If you are expe-
riencing memory shortages you should do ML searches
under CAT with -F since RAxML running in this mode
will only assign the memory it needs for CAT (4 times
less than for GAMMA).
- New -D option: This option further helps to accelerate
ML searches on the original tree on datasets with sev-
eral thousands of taxa. It will stop the ML search much
earlier during the “asymptotic convergence phase” of
the likelihood score, if the relative RF distance be-
tween the trees generated by two succesive cycles of
Lazy Subtree Rearrangements is smaller than 1%. On
datasets with more than 1,000 taxa this yields run-timeimprovements of 50%, while returning almost equally
good trees.
I have also ﬁxed various bugs from version 7.1.0.
Comments and suggestions are always welcome.

Software Tandem
Dear EvolDir community,
we have recently released tandem 1.0, a software for the
automated binning of microsatellite alleles.
While programs for microsatellite analyses, such as Ar-
lequin, Structure, IM(a) and others expect microsatel-
lite allele sizes to be whole numbers, genotyping gen-
erally leads to allele sizes with two decimals. Due to
’allelic drift’, binning of allele sizes is a non- trivial
problem, and manual rounding to the nearest whole
numbers may result in under- or overestimates of al-
lelic richness (besides being tedious and error-prone).
tandem is an easy-to-use program that integrates au-
tomated allele binning into population genetics and ge-
nomics workﬂows. It is designed to accept ﬁles in MSA
and Convert formats, and therefore needs no reformat-
ting of data if one of these two programs is part of the
workﬂow.
The program and a manual are freely avail-
able at www.evolution.unibas.ch/salzburger/-
software/tandem.htm The article is avail-
able on the Bioinformatics website at http:/-

Tree construction answers
This was the original question.
Dear Evoldirs,
Recently, I am trying to identify the best estimated tree
using 10 nuclear DNA intronic sequences. As you might
know, each nuclear gene might have diﬀerent evolution-
ary rate. I’ve seen many papers dealing constructing
tree by combined nuclear DNA dataset. My question is
if it is the best to estimate the tree using many nu-
clear DNA markers which has diﬀerent evolutionary
rate. How about is the case for mitochondrial genome?
Some use several mtDNA fragments and other use com-
plete mtDNA. In mt genome, 13 coding genes, several
rRNA, tRNA, and control region are present. If you use
only 2 ~3 selected mtDNA markers to draw tree, would
it tell you the same tree with the one drawn from com-
plete mtDNA? Are there diﬀerent evolutionary rate for
each genes of mtDNA as well? How diﬀerent are they?
Are there good references to read?
Please let me know.
Best Junghwa AN
1) Hello Jungwha, Mt genes can have diﬀerent evolu-
tionary rates - we found this out with some of the work
we did (papers attached), and Jeﬀ Palmer has found
this as well. I’d be curious to hear what kind of re-
sponses you get - would you post them on evoldir when
they come in? Thanks! Camille
2) Hello Jungwha,
Well, I will start oﬀ by saying that I’m not a phyloge-
neticist. But I was just talking to one last week about
using multiple loci for making trees, and he was making
it very clear that all genes have independent evolution-
ary histories, so simply concatenating a handful of genes
doesn’t necessarily give you a more complete history of
the evolutionary history of that organism. I think the
way to deal with that is to publish the individual gene60 EvolDir July 1, 2009
trees along with any concatenated tree. In that light, it
shouldn’t necessarily matter that much if some of the
loci are linked, but you could fairly easily test that pre-
sumption by testing for linkage disequilibrium among
your loci. As for paralogy, I am not sure of all the ways
to test for that, but I do know that if you translate any
of the coding portions of the genes you sequenced and
ﬁnd stop codons in the middle of the gene or perhaps
high dN/dS ratios, that can indicate a lack of function-
ality and thus perhaps paralogy. If you are referring to
nuclear paralogs of mitochondrial genes, that certainly
happens, and there are some known cases of that. Be-
cause mutation rates are so diﬀerent between nuclear
and mt genes, you could take a look at your substitu-
tion rates and see if they are dramatically lower in any
of your suspected paralogs - that could indicate nuclear
paralogs.
Camille
3) Hi,
as each dataset is diﬀerent, you may try at ﬁrst to do
separate analyses for all regions and compare the trees.
If they are incongruent to a large degree, it is not a
good idea to combine the data.
Best, Judith Dr. Judith Fehrer Institute of Botany
Czech Academy of Sciences Zamek 1 25243 Pruhonice
Czech Republic
4) I can’t say I’ve done this, so I’m sure you’ll get more
experienced responses, but I doubt that you would see
as large of diﬀerences with coding regions in mitochon-
drial DNA as you would in nuclear DNA. The main
reason is that mtDNA should really be considered one
large linked set of genes (due to size and how quickly it
evolves). Using multiple mtDNA coding regions is more
like pseudoreplication in statistics than actual replica-
tion, whereas if you used several unlinked coding re-
gions of nuclear DNA, you should be getting actual
replication.
Julie
5) As to control for mutational variance, long sequence
might help, e.g. long segment of mtDNA. However, it
only tells you one particular gene history (No recombi-
nation inside). However, 10 independent nuclear DNA
intronic sequences have diﬀerent coalesent histories. so
best way to do it is not combine them together. Rather,
you should use ways that recently burgeoning in this
ﬁeld, like programs BEST, Bucky, things like that.

He6) I good place to start is reading papers by S. V Ed-
wards and his group. A recent one is Edwards S, V.
(2009) Is a new and general theory of molecular sys-
tematics emerging? Evolution 63, 1-19. They also have
a good program to use for multiple genes called BEST.
This program gets around problems of simply concate-
nating the sequences with diﬀerent rates.
Good luck, Alicia Toon
7) In this case, I’m referring to statistical replication
rather than cell or DNA replication. When you are
trying to ascertain relationships between species, the
reason we want many characters is because we need
multiple types of evidence that reﬂect the same evolu-
tionary pattern. This is why it is so important to use
unlinked genes: assuming there is no selection on them
and they recombine freely, they should evolve indepen-
dently. Therefore, if they all give the same relationship

UK research policy
Dear EvolDir community
Those of you with links to the UK research commu-
nity may share my concern with the current drastic
change in the mission of the UK research councils: they
have been strongly directed by the government to fund
more commercial-orientated research and research in
pre- speciﬁed areas (which seem to show little imagina-
tion).
This policy hits evolutionary research particularly hard,
of course. It is also short-sighted and self-defeating
from a wider scientiﬁc point of view.
UK citizens and ex-pats may wish to consider signing
a petition to the prime minister here:
http://petitions.number10.gov.uk/honest-discovery/
For those of you not in this constituency, I hope this
movement may spur similar appeals against this trend
in other countries too.

Berlin MateChoice
The Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research
(IZW) in Berlin is Germany’s premier wildlife research
institute and funded by the federal government of Ger-
many and the state government of Berlin. The IZW fo-
cuses on the life histories and mechanisms of evolution-
ary adaptations of mammals and birds and their con-
servation in natural and anthropogenically inﬂuenced
environments. The institute operates within the ﬁelds
of evolutionary ecology and genetics, wildlife diseases
and reproduction biology and management, has excel-
lent facilities and is currently expanding its research
programme ( http://www.izw-berlin.de ).
The institute has received funding for a major network
project on “olfactory mate choice - immune system, ol-
factory receptors and their adaptive value” under the
leadership of Prof Dr Simone Sommer. Olfaction plays
a central role for mate choice in mammals, but there
is a lack of understanding of the underlying proximate
and ultimate aspects of olfactory signal evolution. Re-
cent studies highlighted the importance of the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) for female choice
which raises the question how volatiles, olfactory re-
ceptors and the MHC co-evolved in mammalian mating
systems. The overall project will use a broad genomic
and immunological approach to analyse this question,
thereby combining state-of-the-art transcriptome anal-
yses with detailed immunological studies and extensive
ﬁeld work in long-term projects on two species with
contrasting social and mating systems, the greater sac-
winged bat in Costa Rica and the spotted hyena in
Tanzania. The network consists of the IZW (olfactory
mate choice, Prof Dr Simone Sommer, PD Dr Christian
Voigt, Dr Marion East, Prof Dr Heribert Hofer), the
Leibniz Institute for Age Research in Jena (transcrip-
tome analysis, PD Dr Matthias Platzer), the Charit´ e
in Berlin (immunogenetics, Prof Dr Andreas Ziegler,
Dr. Barbara Uchanska-Ziegler) and the University of
Geneva, Switzerland (olfactory receptor genes, Prof Dr
Michel Milinkovitch). Currently we seek applications
for
1 Postdoc: evolutionary immune genetics of mate
choice (ref: 13/2009) The postdoc will co-ordinate the
network, study the MHC of both study species and
co-ordinate lab and ﬁeld work in Berlin. The success-
ful candidate will have a PhD in evolutionary genet-
ics, zoology or related disciplines, a strong backgroundin behavioural ecology, genetics and evolution, excel-
lent knowledge of statistics, organisational skills, and
a strong publication record. Experience in evolution-
ary immune genetics, particularly MHC, olfaction, and
mammalian mating systems will be an advantage.
1 Phd: mate choice and olfaction in bats (ref: 14/2009)
This project will focus on mate choice mechanisms in
the harem-polygynous social system of the greater sac-
winged bat (Saccopteryx bilineata) by combining be-
havioural, immunological and genetic work. In colonies
of Saccopteryx bilineata territorial males each defend
a group of females, despite their incapability to mo-
nopolise the reproductive success with harem females.
During courtship, males display scent compounds from
pouches in their wing membranes in front of females and
females probably base their mate choice decision mostly
on volatiles. Field work will include odour collection,
tissue collection and behavioural observations including
choice experiments. Laboratory work includes chemi-
cal, immunological and/or genetic work. The success-
ful candidate will have a diploma or MSc in Biology,
Zoology or related disciplines, a strong background in
behavioural ecology, genetics and evolution, above av-
erage achievements in undergraduate studies, excellent
knowledge of statistics, organisational skills, ability to
work under diﬃcult conditions in a team and profound
knowledge of English (speaking and writing). Experi-
ence in ﬁeld work, immunological or molecular genetic
lab work and knowledge of Spanish will be an advan-
tage.
1 Phd: mate choice and olfaction in spotted hyenas (ref:
15/2009) This project will integrate genetic, chemical
and behavioural aspects of olfaction to investigate the
importance of olfactory cues in mate choice in the spot-
ted hyena (Crocuta crocuta); a social carnivore that
exhibits strong female mate choice. The candidate will
conduct ﬁeld work for approximately six months per
year on a well studied population of individually known
spotted hyenas in the Serengeti, Tanzania. Field work
will entail both the collection of detailed behaviour data
and odour and genetic samples from known individuals.
Laboratory work will involve olfactory analyses, im-
munological and/or genetic work. The successful can-
didate will have a diploma or MSc in Biology, Zoology
or related disciplines, require experience of behavioural
research, above average achievements in undergraduate
studies, excellent knowledge of statistics, organisational
skills, a proven ability in the lab, a driving licence,

The Experimental Ecology Group (Prof. P. Schmid-
Hempel) has an opening:
Post-doctoral Position
(Genomics of a host-parasite system) against the back-
ground of studying the ecology and genetics of infec-
tious diseases and their role for host populations or
communities. The PostDoc will be part of the team
using Bombus spp. and their parasites, especially the
trypanosome Crithidia bombi, as a study system. Cur-
rently, the genomic toolbox for this system is rapidly
expanding and will allow approaching the basic ques-
tions at the genetic level in an unprecedented scale.
This will allow tracing changes in gene frequencies or
signs of selection in a ﬁeld-based system. Our broader
interests are in the ecology and evolution of this model
system with questions about host-parasite co-evolution
at diﬀerent scales, the epidemics of an infection, or vari-
ation in the expression of immune defence genes. The
ideal candidate has experience in applying molecular
tools to such questions, is knowledgeable in the use of
gene data banks and familiar with the tools of bioinfor-
matics, e.g. to assemble sequences and doing compar-
ative studies. He/she should have an interest in evo-
lutionary and population biology and - genetics. The
position is available for 2-4 years; it is embedded in an
active research group with long-term experience with
this system and such questions. We oﬀer a stimulating
research environment, embedded in the Institute of In-
tegrative Biology ( www.ibz.ethz.ch ) and ETH at large.
Research facilities and support are excellent and the
projects have solid funding. Please send applications,
with CV, publication list, names of referees, and state-
ment of research interest to Prof. Paul Schmid-Hempel,
preferably by email (psh@env.ethz.ch ). Please compile
the documents to a single pdf ﬁle if possible. Screen-
ing of applications will start 26 June 2009 or until postis ﬁlled. For more information, check our web page

Post-Doctoral Researcher
PROJECT: Plant Sex and the Evolution of Plant De-
fenses Against Parasites
LOCATION: Department of Plant Biology, North Car-
olina State University, Raleigh NC, USA
DESCRIPTION: The Johnson Lab ( www.evoeco.org )
in the Department of Plant Biology at North Carolina
State University seeks a Post-Doctoral researcher to
work on an NSF funded project examining how a loss
of sexual reproduction in plants inﬂuences phenotypic
and molecular evolution of defenses against plant par-
asites (insect herbivores and fungal pathogens). This
work focuses on the evening primrose genus Oenothera
which has experienced over 20 independent transitions
between sexual and functionally asexual reproduction.
We have recently shown that these repeated losses of
sex have lead to the evolution of increased susceptibil-
ity to generalist herbivores and decreased susceptibility
to specialist herbivores. We are now testing theoreti-July 1, 2009 EvolDir 69
cal predictions about how a loss of sex inﬂuences the
molecular evolution of plant defense genes as well as
the expression of resistance traits functionally related
to these genes.
Consistent with the strengths and interests of the suc-
cessful applicant, there will be the opportunity to con-
tribute to multiple aspect s of the project. These in-
clude the cloning, sequencing and expression analysis
of plant defense genes; ﬁeld work in North and South
America; phytochemical analysis by HPLC-MS, and
the use of comparative phylogenetic and population ge-
netic tools for the analysis of various types of molecu-
lar and phenotypic data. Consideration will be given
to all candidates with expertise in ecology and/or evo-
lution and applicants with experience conducting both
molecular and ﬁeld work are particularly encouraged to
apply.
START DATE: September 1st, 2009, but this is nego-
tiable. The position is for 24 months, with a possible
extension contingent on funding. Starting salary will
be commensurate with experience; the position includes
medical insurance and beneﬁts.
APPLICATION: Applicants should send a cover-
ing letter, curriculum vitae and contact details for
three or more references to Dr. Marc Johnson
(marc johnson@ncsu.edu) in the Department of Plant
Biology at North Carolina State University.
North Carolina State University is located in Raleigh,

POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLAR
Behavioral Ecology of Social Insects
The UC Berkeley Natural History Museums and De-
partment of Environmental Science, Policy and Man-
agement at UC-Berkeley are currently seeking one Post-
doctoral Scholar in the laboratory of Dr. Neil Tsutsui.
We are seeking a Postdoctoral Scholar to study the be-
havioral ecology of social insects. Previous work has
focused on the genetics, behavior, and chemical ecology
of the invasive, Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). In
this species, genetic changes during introduction have
altered individual behavior and, in turn, the social or-
ganization of introduced populations. These changes
have contributed to the Argentine ant’s invasive suc-
cess by promoting the formation of massive “super-
colonies” in the introduced range. Publications from
previous research can be downloaded from: http:// na-
ture.berkeley.edu/tsutsuilab. Current research topics
include the chemical basis of colonymate recognition,
population genetics of native and introduced popula-
tions, and the development of genomic tools for studies
of behavior, learning and memory in Argentine ants and
other social insects.
The central focus of the Postdoctoral Scholars research
will be the structure and function of colonymate recog-
nition systems in the Argentine ant. The Scholar will
perform manipulative laboratory experiments to ex-plore the role that social environment and individual
experience play in the development of colony identity.
The Postdoctoral Scholar will also have opportunities
to contribute to ongoing research by using functional
genetic, genomic or neurophysiological approaches.
Applicants should have a strong background in one or
more of the following areas: behavioral ecology, chemi-
cal ecology, population genetics, genomics and gene ex-
pression, and genetics of behavior, learning and mem-
ory. Previous experience in insect biology is desirable,
but not required. The salary range is between $35,508
- $41,496 or commensurate with experience; generous
beneﬁts are included. A start date during early Fall
2009 is preferable. Applicants must have less than ﬁve
years of post-doctoral service.
Applicants should submit, by July 15, 2009, a CV, a
brief statement of research interests, copies of relevant
publications and/or manuscripts, and contact informa-
tion for two references. Application materials may be
submitted by email or postal mail.

UMichigan 2 Phylogenetics
Two postdoctoral positions in phylogenetics
PIs: Dr. L. Lacey Knowles, University of Michigan; Dr.
Laura Kubatko, Ohio State University
Research Project:
Two postdoctoral positions are available to join an
NSF-funded project on species-tree estimation - a new
and exciting area of phylogenetics that uses population-
genetic based approaches for estimating species rela-
tionships. Through the combination of empirical inves-
tigation, simulation, and theory, the research will ex-
amine how accurate estimates of species relationships
might be achieved given the messiness of real data (e.g.,
loci with low levels of variation, missing data, incom-
plete taxon sampling, and realistic sampling eﬀort). As
part of the broader research team, the positions will in-
volve collaborative investigations between the Knowles
and Kubatko labs, with each postdoc being based out
of the separate labs and focusing on separate but com-
plementary components of the research.
Requirements:
Both desired candidates will possess an interest in /
experience with phylogenetics, or coalescent-based ap-
proaches for demographic analysis. For the position
in the Knowles lab, knowledge of basic programming
skills (such as writing PERL scripts), and a familiarity
with coalescent-based population genetic simulations,78 EvolDir July 1, 2009
are desirable, as are basic molecular laboratory skills
(such as DNA/RNA extraction and PCR). Experience
with next-generation sequencing techniques (e.g., 454
sequencing) would be beneﬁcial, but is not required.
For the position in the Kubatko lab, knowledge of sci-
entiﬁc programming (preferably in C/C++ or Perl)
and familiarity with statistical methodology for phy-
logenetic estimation are desirable; formal training in
statistics would also be beneﬁcial.
The University of Michigan and Ohio State University
both have several labs dedicated to the study of phy-
logenetics, population and evolutionary genetics, and
speciation. As such, the postdoctoral fellows will bene-
ﬁt from a rich academic environment, as well as excel-
lent genomic and computational facilities.
The positions can be ﬁlled immediately and at
least two years of funding are available. To
apply, email a statement of research interests
and a curriculum vitae to L. Lacey Knowles
(knowlesl@umich.edu <mailto:knowlesl@umich.edu >
) and Laura Kubatko (lkubatko@stat.osu.edu

UOregon FishAnatomicalEvolution
POSTDOCTORAL POSITION The genetics and evo-
lution of skeletal diversity in ﬁshes
An NSF-funded postdoctoral position is available in the
laboratory of Monte Westerﬁeld (University of Oregon
Institute of Neuroscience) to study experimentally can-
didate genes for the diversiﬁcation of skeletal architec-
ture in ﬁsh species related to zebraﬁsh.
The position is available through the Phenoscape
project ( http://phenoscape.org ), a collaboration
among evolutionary and model organism biologists
(including Paula Mabee of the University of South
Dakota, Monte Westerﬁeld of the Zebraﬁsh Infor-
mation Network, and Todd Vision of the National
Evolutionary Synthesis Center). The aim of the
project is to develop a knowledgebase that can be
used to generate hypotheses about the genetic basis
of anatomical variation among species. The current
version of the knowledgebase combines information
from genetically characterized mutant phenotypes in
zebraﬁsh and naturally variable phenotypes in the
Ostariophysi, with an emphasis on the skeleton. A
postdoc is being sought to test experimentally the
evolutionary and mechanistic hypotheses that are
being generated by the knowledgebase and showcase
the utility of the approach.
Applicants should have a Ph.D. in molecular, devel-
opmental or evolutionary biology and be proﬁcient in
DNA cloning technology and mRNA in situ hybridiza-
tion. The start date will be at the applicant’s earliest
convenience. The position is initially for one year with
possibility for extension. Salary will be commensurate
with experience (Kirschstein NRSA levels).
To apply, please submit a cover letter, CV, statement

Phylogenetic Analysis of Clade Diversiﬁcation: Is Ro-

London Wednesday 8th July 2009, 6 pmJuly 1, 2009 EvolDir 83
The meeting is open to visitors. Wine will be served
after the lecture to members and guests
Abstract: Species richness is not distributed evenly
across the tree of life. Some clades are exceptionally
diverse, others surprisingly species-poor. The recon-
struction of phylogenetic trees and their calibration in
geologic time has improved our ability to detect these
patterns, but by how much? In this talk I review a spec-
trum of methods for inferring diversiﬁcation rates and
consider their robustness, focusing in particular on the
question of whether time calibration is necessary or use-
ful. Several case studies in angiosperm evolution will be
highlighted, including Hawaiian silverswords and both
recent and old radiations within the large clade Legu-
minosae. Although research on diversiﬁcation rates has
been dominated by questions of evolutionary success“,
I will end with a discussion of the ”depauperons“ of life,
those clades with surprisingly little diversity.

Aug30-Sep2
A workshop on “EVOLUTION IN METAPOPULA-
TIONS” will be held in La Fouly, Switzerland,
from August 30th to September 2nd 2009.
Spatial population structure is both a creative and
a constraining force in evolution. On the one hand,
it leads to genetic variance among local populations,
which may promote local adaptation. On the other
hand, it can hinder the spread of favorable alleles and
may lead to decreased local genetic diversity and to in-
creased homozygosity and mutation load.
Recent theoretical and empirical developments have
been investigating how quantitative traits might be
aﬀected by the spatial structure, dispersal and selec-
tive pressures. This research has shown that popula-
tion structure has many important evolutionary conse-
quences, and can aﬀect adaptation to changing environ-
ments, the evolution of breeding systems, the structure
of quantitative traits, or the evolution of sex.
This summer school will bring together six invited
speakers and a number of younger researchers to
present and discuss both theoretical and empirical as-
pects of evolution in spatially structured populations,
with special emphasis on quantitative traits. It will
take place in La Fouly (VS) where we have already held
several highly successful summer schools.
Invited speakers:
- Sergey Gavrilets - Ilka Hanski - Sally Otto - John
Pannell - Illik Saccheri - Mike Whitlock
Invited speakers and participants will have the oppor-July 1, 2009 EvolDir 85

Registration fees are CHF 300.-, including local accom-
modation and food for the whole workshop. Fees are
waived for students from Swiss universities aﬃliated to

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword86 EvolDir July 1, 2009
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
