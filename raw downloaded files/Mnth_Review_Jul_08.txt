Preliminary Announcement and note for your diaries:
Fourth International Conference on Quantitative Ge-
netics: Understanding variation in complex traits
Edinburgh 17-22 June 2012
http://www.icqg4.org.uk/ Variation in quantitative
and other complex phenotypes underpins most impor-
tant traits in human health and disease, agriculture,
natural populations and evolution. The genomics rev-
olution has provided the tools to start the dissection
of such traits, enhancing both their understanding and
exploitation. This has led to an explosion of interest
and new studies across all of biology.
The aim will be to present and discuss state-of-the-art
results, theoretical developments, understanding and
methodology across the whole range of quantitative ge-
netics - the genetic analysis and interpretation of data
on complex traits - and to provide a stimulating confer-
ence in an attractive locale. Topics will include statisti-
cal methods for parameter estimation, including analy-
sis of trait, genomic and functional genomic data; meth-
ods for QTL and gene identiﬁcation; genetic control of
complex traits; prediction of breeding value and indi-
vidual risk, and interpretation of evolutionary change.The meeting will pertain to and span results from,
for example, humans, livestock, crops, micro-organisms
and natural and experimental populations of all species.
The conference will be held at the Edinburgh Inter-
national Conference Centre, and sponsored by the UKs
Genetics Society ( http://www.genetics.org.uk/ ). It fol-
lows previous successful meetings at Iowa State Uni-
versity in Ames, North Carolina State University in
Raleigh, and Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China
(http://www.icqg.org/ ).
Information on the web will be updated in due course.
Meanwhile, for further information please contact a
member of the pro-tem local organising committee: Bill
Hill (w.g.hill@ed.ac.uk) (Chair), Lutz B1nger, DJ de

THE EVOLUTION OF SEX AND ASEXUAL RE-
PRODUCTION
Genetics Society Autumn Meeting, University of Bath,
UK, Sept. 5th 2008
Scientiﬁc organisers: Laurence Hurst (Bath) and Roger
Butlin (Sheﬃeld)
To accompany the presentation of 2008 Mendel Lec-
ture by Professor Matthew Meselson and the 2008 Bal-
four Lecture by Daven Presgraves, The Genetics Soci-
ety is organizing a one day conference on THE EVOLU-
TION OF SEX AND ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION.
This will be held at the University of Bath, UK on Fri-
day 5th September.
While the maintenance of sex and recombination re-
mains an intellectual challenge, the long term persis-
tence of some asexuals is equally puzzling. What if any-
thing can be learnt about the former issues by studying
the latter and vice versa? There are multiple contrast-
ing approaches to these problems: theoretical versus
empirical approaches, genetical verses ecological expla-
nations, ﬁeld versus laboratory systems. This meeting
will bring together all of these strands in current re-
search.

Agricultural Weeds: Bridging the Gap Between Evolu-
tionary Ecology and Crop Science
http://www.plantbio.uga.edu/weeds Sept 11th -13th,
2008
We are pleased to announce a 2-day conference designed
to stimulate conversation between evolutionary ecolo-
gists and applied scientists that study weed adaptation
to the agricultural system. The goal is to foster new,
integrative thinking about the process of weed domes-
tication to agriculture and the evolution of ’weediness.’
Topics include: Weed adaptation to the agricultural
system, transgene movement from crops to wild species,
parasitic weeds, weed shifts and weedy species of future
interest
We will be hosting presentations from the following
speakers as well as a poster session for registrants.
There will be a poster abstract competition for gradu-
ate students and post-docs with the award being $500
travel/housing relief. See the website for details.

Reminder - Abstract deadline on June 6th, 2008!!!
9th International Feline Retrovirus Research Sympo-
sium - Vienna, August 24th - 27th 2008
Dear ColleagueOn behalf of the organizing committee for the 9th In-
ternational Feline Retrovirus Research Symposium to
be held in Vienna, Austria, August 24-27, 2008, I am
pleased to invite you and members of your group to
submit abstracts of your latest work. The conference
promises to be an innovative and exciting blend of retro-
viral research, advances in the cat as a model of infec-
tious disease, cat genomics and viral and host evolution.
Felids and their associated retroviruses oﬀer an unique
opportunity to study evolution of both pathogenic and
apathogenic viruses as well as endogenous retroviruses
and the co-adaptation of their respective hosts. The
scientiﬁc committee therefore also speciﬁcally encour-
ages contributions from researchers interested in feline
and viral evolution.
Submitted abstracts will be reviewed by the scientiﬁc
committee and assigned to oral or poster presentations
(your preference would be helpful) and the best of these
would receive partial or full ﬁnancial support for atten-
dance. A signiﬁcant amount of the budget will be al-
located for this, so we really would encourage abstract
submission.
Please visit the conference website at http://-
www.retrovirus.at for additional information, submis-
sion of abstracts, and registration. Please note the
deadline for abstracts is June 6, 2008 and an early reg-
istration discount deadline is at the same date. Please
feel free to contact the local organizing committee (of-
ﬁce@retrovirus.at) with any questions.
Best wishes,

NHM Oslo 3 Biosystematics
Dear EvolDir,
I would like to forward the announcement for 3
PhD positions, also available at the following link:
http://www.admin.uio.no/opa/ledige-stillinger/2008/-
vit/3Ph.DfellowshipsBiology-08-9783.html 3 Ph.D.
student fellowships in biosystematics/evolutionary
biology available at National Centre for Biosystematics
(NCB), Natural History Museum, University of Oslo
(UiO)The National Centre for Biosystematics (NCB) ( http:/-
/www.nhm.uio.no/ncb/ ) is a strategic, interdisci-
plinary research facility at the Natural History Museum
(NHM), which aims to perform research in modern sys-
tematics and biodiversity on a high international level.
The NCB integrates research groups working on plants,
fungi and animals, which to a large extent utilize simi-
lar molecular genetic tools in their research. The NHM
has a modern DNA laboratory with all necessary fa-
cilities and has access to a pyrosequencing instrument
at the UiO. The Ph.D. students will work in an in-
terdiciplinary and stimulating research environment to-
gether with other Ph.D. students, postdocs and guest
researchers. The fellowships will include research stays
abroad. The fellowships are connected to the following
projects:
(1) Cryptic speciation in arctic plants
This project will follow up recent discoveries in arctic
Draba, showing that there are many cryptic biological
species within what has traditionally been regarded as
well-deﬁned, single taxonomic species. This project will
investigate the generality of this kind of cryptic specia-
tion in arctic plants. It will test whether such speciation
is connected to inbreeding or other factors by compar-
ing diploid species with diﬀerent reproductive systems,
diﬀerent ecological characteristics, and from diﬀerent
taxonomic groups. The Ph.D. student will use a com-
bination of classic biosystematic approaches and devel-
opment of new DNA markers from pyrosequencing to
address the association between development of repro-
ductive barriers and total genomic diﬀerentiation. The
project will also address biogeographic aspect of specia-
tion and include ﬁeld work in various regions, probably
in Alaska, Svalbard, mainland Norway, and the Alps.
The Ph.D. student will work closely together with other
scientists studying the genetic mechanisms involved in
speciation.
(2) Barcoding of DNA preserved in permafrost for re-
construction of past vegetation and climate
This project is connected to the ongoing EU project
ECOCHANGE (2007-2011), where NCB has devel-
oped a barcoding database for 850 arctic vascular plant
species. This reference database is used for species iden-
tiﬁcation based on pyrosequencing of ancient DNA pre-
served in permafrost. The Ph.D. student will be part of
the international ECOCHANGE team and develop new
DNA markers for further resolution of some important
vascular plant genera and initiate the development of
a similar barcoding system for mosses. The project in-
volves research stays in other European countries to de-
velop expertise in pyrosequencing, bioinformatics, and
analysis of ancient DNA.14 EvolDir July 1, 2008
(3) Sexual selection, genetic diﬀerentiation and repro-
ductive isolation in birds. Previous studies have identi-
ﬁed highly divergent patterns of genetic and morpholog-
ical diﬀerentiation, and varying degree of reproductive
isolation, in three species in the avian sub-family Saxi-
colinae (the bluethroat Luscinia svecica, the common
redstart Phoenicurus phoenicurus and the common
stonechat Saxicola rubicola). This project will inves-
tigate genetic and morphological diﬀerentiation within
this sub-family in detail, using a combination of ﬁeld
experiments, molecular methods and measurements of
study skins in museum collections. The project consists
of three main parts: (1) molecular phylogeny of Saxicol-
inae, (2) phylogeography in the three mentioned species
within this sub-familiy, and (3) experimental investiga-
tion of the role of a sexually selected character in sub-
species discrimination within one of these species (the
bluethroat). The research fellow will visit the largest
natural history collections in Europe to collect morpho-
logical data and samples for DNA analyses, and per-
form ﬁeld experiments at NHMˆ as ﬁeld station in ˜Avre
Heimdalen, Oppland, Norway.
Applicants must hold a Masterˆ as degree (or equivalent)
in biology, preferably with a broad practical and theo-
retic background in molecular genetic methods.
The purpose of the fellowship is research training lead-
ing to the successful completion of a PhD degree. When
evaluating the application, emphasis will will appli-
cantˆ as academic and personal prerequisites to carry out
the project.
The fellowships are ﬁnanced for four years, with a com-
pulsory work load of 25%.

Senckenberg GlobalChangeGenetics
Senckenberg.GlobalChangeGenetics
Graduate position:
A PhD position is available in global change biol-
ogy/population genetics at the Department of Limnol-ogy & Conservation, Senckenberg Research Institute
and Natural History Museum, Germany.
Current models suggest that global warming will lead
to massive species extinctions in the near future. It is
expected that certain traits increase susceptibility to-
wards changing climate, including reduced dispersal,
low genetic diversity, small population size, isolation
and low tolerance towards temperature changes. In
Europe, several cold-adapted species of plants and ani-
mals persist as isolated glacial relicts in high altitudes.
Many of these species combine several, if not all of the
above-listed factors and may thus be among the ﬁrst
species to become extinct if global temperature shows
further increase. The PhD candidate will develop and
apply genetic markers (e.g., microsatellites, AFLP, se-
quence data) to investigate genetic population structure
in cold-adapted, montane species in central European
mountain ranges. In particular, research will focus on
patterns of gene ﬂow and isolation among populations,
inbreeding levels within isolated relict populations, and
to identify conservation units. Besides the molecular
part, ﬁeld work and controlled laboratory experiments
on temperature and general stress tolerance will be con-
ducted. The study is not focused on a certain taxo-
nomic group; research will thus likely comprise both
plant and animal species. We are looking for a highly
motivated student with a strong interest in biodiversity,
conservation and population genetics. The candidate
is expected to have some experience in the laboratory,
ideally with the application of microsatellite markers
and/or DNA sequencing. Knowledge of German lan-
guage is no precondition, but we expect the willing-
ness to learn some German during the stay. A valid
international drivers licence is required for ﬁeld sam-
pling. The Senckenberg Research Institute and Nat-
ural History Museum (head quarter in Frankfurt am
Main) is among the largest natural history museums in
Europe and has a longstanding tradition in high qual-
ity biodiversity research. The Department of Limnol-
ogy & Conservation is located at the research station
Gelnhausen. The station has all facilities required for
this research (fully equipped molecular lab, laborato-
ries for sample sorting and microscopical analysis, ﬁeld
equipment). Gelnhausen is a quaint town in close prox-
imity to Frankfurt am Main. The city has a picturesque
historic Old Town with several historic sites from the
medieval times and is surrounded by beautiful moun-
tain ranges. Frankfurt am Main, an international city
with a rich and diverse cultural life and unique interna-
tional transport connections, can be reached within 30
minutes by car or train. In order to apply, please send

netic data (see PLoS Genet 4 e1000078), in order to
analyze DNA sequence data obtained from a large col-
lection of the bacteria from around the world. Previ-
ous analyses has shown that the bacteria has a similar
history of migration to that of the humans that carry
them, while evolving at a much faster rate. See e.g.
Science 299, 1582-1585, PNAS 101, 4746-4751, Nature
445,915-918. This project will exploit unpublished data
from hundreds of additional isolates from diverse ethnic
groups, including several hundred strains taken from
Siberians. Candidates should have a good mathemat-
ical training and some interest in one or more of evo-
lutionary biology/anthropology/genetics. The project
will be supervised by Daniel Falush using data gener-
ated in the laboratories of Mark Achtman and others.
Previous experience has shown that the unique proper-
ties of H. pylori make it an ideal system within which
to develop novel genetic analysis tools that can sub-
sequently be applied to a wide variety of organisms
and questions. The position is open to students of
any nationality and comes with a stipend of 20,000 Eu-
ros per year + student fees. Applicants should contact
d.falush@ucc.ie with a CV and the names of 2 referees.

UKonstanz MateChoiceMHC
PhD position in Fish ecology, behaviour and evolution
at the Limnological Institute, University of Konstanz -
Germany
In the research group of Jasminca Behrmann-Godel we
are looking for a PhD student. The position is part
of a DFG project (German science foundation) and is
funded for preliminary 16 months (an extension to a
total of 3 years is possible).
Aim of the project is to investigate the inﬂuence ofMHC (major histocompatibility complex) gene vari-
ability on social behaviours like mate and shoal choice
in perch (/perca ﬂuviatilis/ L). In a preliminary study,
we have identiﬁed MHC genes in perch and designed
speciﬁc primers to amplify a high number of MHC
class II alleles. This information will be used to set
up an individual genotyping method using e.g. SSCP
(single strand conformation polymorphism) or DGGE
(denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) in combina-
tion with cloning and sequencing of MHC alleles. In-
dividually genotyped perch will then be tested in be-
havioural experiments to investigate the inﬂuence of
MHC allele variability on mate choice or shoal choice
decisions. Thus the project combines modern molecu-
lar genetic techniques with behavioural experiments on
wild caught and laboratory bred ﬁsh.
Our research group is a part of the ﬁsh ecology group
of Prof. Reiner Eckmann at the Limnological Insti-
tute of the University of Konstanz. The Limnological
Institute provides a pleasant and exciting research en-
vironment. Besides a small molecular genetics lab, it
has an aquarium facility, outdoor mesokosms for semi
natural studies and oﬀers best conditions for any kind
of ﬁshing and aquatic research in Lake Constance.
Further information on our research can be obtained
from our web page: http://www.uni-konstanz.de/-
FuF/Bio/forsch/limno/ﬁshecology/ . Besides research,
PhD students are expected to assist in undergraduate
teaching and supervision. The University of Konstanz
is one of the nine excellent universities in Germany, se-
lected in 2007.
Applicants should have a master’s degree (MA or
Diplom) in biology/zoology and research experience
in evolutionary biology with good expertise in molec-
ular genetics and lab work. Practical skills in the
work with ﬁsh are helpful but not compulsory. Inter-
ested students should email their applications contain-
ing a CV, statement of research interests and email
addresses of two references. Review of applications
will commence on July 20 ^th 2008. Starting date is
August/September 2008. Applications should be sent

* Topic Understanding the relationships between dif-
ferent species may have consequences both at practical
level (e.g., history of a pathogen agent involved in a
disease), and at fundamental level (e.g., construction
of the tree of life: ﬁnding the history of all organisms).
The study of evolution requires various and numerous
pieces of data such as morphological characteristics of
a set of specimens or, more importantly, genomic and
proteomic sequences of a group of species, functional
and structural annotations. For several years now,
there has been an avalanche of data available. Com-
bining and integrating masses of phylogenomics data is
of parmount importance for better understanding evo-
lution.
* Background More speciﬁcally, this subject is part of
two projects, pPOD and Microbiogenomics.
** On the one hand, pPOD is an international project,
in which data are collected throughout the world by re-
search groups having distinct interests (specialized on
diﬀerent groups of species). Data collected by those
various groups are available in a variety of formats (re-
lational, tabulated ﬁles, and so on.).
** On the other hand, partners of the the French
project “ANR masses de donnees” Microbiogenomics
study evolution by building phylogenetic trees based
on families of proteins, part of their data is currently
stored in ﬂat-ﬁles format (trees) and within a relational
warehouse (sequences, annotations). In both projects,
phylogenetists need to ask complex questions involving
all the data, both produced and consumed by the vari-
ous steps of the generation and analysis of phylogenetic
trees, including the trees themselves or families of trees.
Examples of queries include: What are the diﬀerences
between those two trees? If I modify the alignment by
adding gaps, what would be the impact on the ﬁnal
generated tree¿‘ or
”Among the available trees, what are the subtrees
whose proteins are all involved in a given metabolic
pathway? Which are the protein modules appearing in
trees in which a given group of species is monophyletic¿‘
* Work The aim of this work is to enable various phy-
logenetists to make use of all these data in a uniﬁed
way, in the context of a relational database. One of the
main challenges lies in that the relational model doesnot ﬁt with hierarchical (tree-based) data.
As a ﬁrst step, queries frequently asked by major pPOD
and Microbiogenomics partners should be identiﬁed.
Queries may be increasingly complex and can be ex-
pressed using diﬀerent kinds of language (relational al-
gebra, SQL and so on). In particular, queries may in-
volve families of trees, comparison and clustering algo-
rithms, and topological features of the trees.
A classiﬁcation of queries should then be proposed.
The third step would consist in exploring the limita-
tions of current relational standards (latest versions
of SQL) to represent phylogenetic data and express
queries. This study should provide the building blocks
for a more expressive high-level query language.

EvolutionaryNeuroscience
A PhD mutlidisciplinary studentship is available in the
School of Biological Sciences, University of Southamp-
ton, UK. The project will use a combination of bioin-
formatics and neuroscience to investigate the aﬀects of
alcohol on nematodes from an evolutionary perspective.Details below:
BACKGROUND. There is an urgent need to better un-
derstand the biological mechanism that underpins ad-
diction. Alcohol is recognised amongst the most harm-
ful addictive drugs and, despite its simple structure,
acts through complex interactions between molecular,
cellular and systems level targets. This studentship
will investigate the acute and chronic impact of ethanol
through use of the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans,
as a model organism. Many of the mammalian molec-
ular and cellular targets implicated in the action of al-
cohol are conserved in this organism and we have es-
tablished a range of relevant behavioural and electro-
physiological assays. This project will build a database
of ethanol and its targets which, using evolutionary
bioinformatics, will be used to predict key molecular
targets of ethanol action for experimental investigation
in C. elegans. Mutants lacking the ethanol target will
be screened for modiﬁed response to acute or chronic
ethanol treatment, deﬁning in teractions and providing
insight into neural substrate of ethanol’s action, which
can then be modelled or directly applied in the more
complex organization that underlie alcohol (and likely
other addictive drugs) in the mammalian brain.
TRAINING. The work recognises that the modern
neuroscientist requires broad exposure to several sub-
disciplines. The Studentship will actively encourage the
acquisition of such skills and provides an opportunity
to develop skills at the interface between bioinformatics
and experimental biology. Further, the studentship will
be supported by the School of Biological Sciences Grad-
uate School, which has a broad portfolio of general and
specialised training required in the modern workplace.
FUNDING. The Gerald Kerkutt Charitable Trust pro-
vides funding for 3/4 years and provides opportunity
to apply for support for further specialist training con-
summate with the projects requirement for a broad and
integrative training. This is a fully funded studentship
with a student stipend set at the same level as a re-
search council studentship (currently £12,940 per an-
num).
REQUIREMENTS. Applicants should be UK/EU stu-
dents with a degree of 2-1 or higher in a relevant disci-
pline (e.g. Neuroscience / Physiology/ Pharmacology/
Biochemistry/ Molecular Biology / Genetics) and a cu-
riosity and enthusiasm for research. Laboratory experi-
ence (e.g. ﬁnal year project) is essential, with a strong
preference for some experience of neuroscience. The
candidate must also have an interest in, and aptitude
for, computers.
CONTACT. Interested students should contact Dr
Richard Edwards (r.edwards@soton.ac.uk), ProfessorJuly 1, 2008 EvolDir 21
Lindy Holden-Dye (lmhd@soton.ac.uk) or Dr Vincent

Title: Common Eider Population Dynamics - M.S. Po-
sition
School: Utah State University, Logan, UT
Departments: The Department of Wildland Resources
and the Ecology Center http://www.cnr.usu.edu/-
departments/departments/wild/wild http://-
www.usu.edu/ecology/ In collaboration with the
Hudson Bay Project http://research.amnh.org/-
˜ rfr/hbp/ Description of research: Common Eider
(Somateria mollissima) populations around the world
are declining, raising concern amongst managers,
conservation groups, and native communities. Because
of global warming and earlier thawing of the Arctic
icepack, Polar Bears (Ursus arctos) are now coming
to shore earlier than they used to. This will lead to
increased predator-prey interactions between bears and
eiders, and could increase the frequency of catastrophic
egg depredation for coastal eider colonies, as well
as decrease survival of nesting females. Although
Common Eiders have evolved a bet-hedging life history
to cope with some reproductive failure (i.e., they
delay ﬁrst reproduction, live long, and are highly
iteroparous), it is not known how increased exposure
to polar bears (and potentially other predators) will
aﬀect eider populations.
The student will monitor Common Eider reproductivebiology, as well as predator-prey interactions with Polar
Bears and other potential predators, over 2 ﬁeld seasons
near La P´ erouse Bay, Manitoba. The objective of this
project is to develop a generalized population model for
Common Eiders using published data, historical data
from the La P´ erouse Bay study, and the students own
data. The student will then use perturbation analysis
to examine how changes in the frequency distribution
of reproductive success and breeding-season survival of
nesting females aﬀect Common Eider populations.
Stipend: Selected applicant must qualify for one of
the following fellowships oﬀered by USU to cover
two years of research stipend. Tuition costs will also
be covered. http://www.usu.edu/graduateschool/-

waterfowl research and a strong quantitative back-
ground. Applicants must meet the requirements for at
least one of the fellowships listed above.

tists and managing the nationally renowned Chicago
Botanic Garden. A 385-acre living museum, the Gar-
den is built on nine islands that house a collection of
more than 2.3 million plants in 23 specialty gardens,
three native habitats, six miles of shoreline, and 81
acres of waterways. It is one of the few botanic gardens
accredited by the American Association of Museums.
The Garden’s mission commits it to generate knowl-
edge about plants, to share that knowledge widely, and
to educate those who will continue to generate new
knowledge and safeguard our biological heritage. In
fulﬁllment of these commitments, the Garden has spent
the last three decades developing a large, scientiﬁcally
based plant collection that, along with a growing li-
brary, forms the foundation of the research and educa-
tion activities. At the same time, the Garden leadership
has assembled an extraordinary pool of talent and ex-
pertise, including some of the nation’s foremost plant
scientists.

Aligning Dloops
Dear all of you in EvolDir,
I am just wondering ifany of you have experienced
to align hypervariable sites in mitochondrial genome.
(such as control region=D loop) I know many of you
have carried out to align by eyes and hands. I also did
same way but it is very hard to ﬁnd out homologous
region to be aligned in control region among diﬀerent
genera within same tribe. I’ve tried to use Clustal W
for obtaining references. The results turned out compli-
cated and not appropriate for analysis of constructing
trees. How do you deal with this kinds of variable sites
when aligning?
Any comments would be greatly appreciated.
Best wishes, Annie

Dear Brian,
Here is all the answers that I want to put onto.
Thanks Junghwa AnI have tons of experience aligning very diverse sequences
from lentiviruses and other viruses (as well as the com-
plete mitochondrial genomes of vertebrates). Clustal is
a “toy” compared to HMMer, MAAFT and other tools
for multiple sequence alignment. Write back, and I will
give you help.

Hi Annie,It can be a hard job to align control region
sequences between diﬀerent species! You did not write
with which species you work.I worked mainly with se-
quences of ﬁshes and it is hardly possible to align be-
tween diﬀerent species. I worked on intraspeciﬁc phy-
logenies and tried to ﬁnd outgroups. Even within the
same Genera of e.g. Sprattus or Mullus I could not
align sequences. Though, for some groups it is still pos-
sible and I always do this to design new primers (where
I look for conserved elemnts). I can recommend you a
paper that deals with the appropriateness of the control
region for interspeciﬁc phylogenies of ﬁshes (they also
descibe how they aligned): Lee W-J, Conroy J, How-
ell WH and Kocher TD (1995) Structure and Evolution
of Teleost Mitochondrial Control Regions. Journal of
Molecular Evolution, 41, 54-66.To manually align se-
quences, and most probably you have to do that as you
might have to deal with doublications of part of the se-
quences and many large indels, I always start with the
central conserved region. If you have sequences of the
tRNA-Pro at the 5’end and/or the tRNA-Phe at theJuly 1, 2008 EvolDir 39
3’end it is not as good to start from there. You should
be aware that these are the most variable regions and
very often are not homologous due to large indels right
at the beginnig/end of the control region. It’s also good
to search for conserved sequence blocks and ﬁx those.
Have a look at this publication: Saccone C, Pesole G
and Sbisa E (1991) The main regulatory region of mam-
malian mitochondrial DNA: Structure-function model
and evolutionary pattern. Journal of Molecular Evo-
lution 33, 83-91.When you have many diﬀerent species
you should also be aware of the strong variation within
a species, which can strongly inﬂuence your alignement.
I would not recommend this region for interspeciﬁc phy-
logenies unless you have no other choice.When I had to
deal with outgroup sequences for intraspeciﬁc phylo-
genies I deleted the hypervariable (5’ or 3’) ends and
tried to use the central conserved region only, but there
was not enough variation within the species to evalu-
ate the “oldest haplotype” as this was dependant from
how much I deleted. All my phylogenies stayed un-
rooted. Maybe this is what you can do for your in-
terspeciﬁc phylogenies: just use the central conserved
region.Another thing that might help is downloading
additional sequences of related species from Genbank
and use them to improve the alignment.I hope this will
help you somehow and if you have any questions don’t
hesitate to write back.
All the best, Paul
Hello,The control region and especially its HVR can
be really problematic to align in divergent taxa. It
can contain repetitive sequences or just have received
many substitutions. In mammals it’s removed from
alignments even in closely related taxa (recently di-
verged). In ﬁsh it’s more conserved and can actually
be used in phylogenetic reconstruction at the genus
level (see Doukakis’s papers). Douzery has published
on the cervid control region.I would remove it from
the analysis. The rest of the mitochondrial genome se-
quence should be more informative at this scale anyway.
In cases of diﬃcult to align sequences (indels, varying
length, etc), a simultaneous alignment and phylogeny
method can be employed to integrate across alignment
and tree space. POY, BaliPhy, and StatAlign are pro-
grams implementing these methods.

http://koloko.net Hi Annie
You can exclude sites (across all taxa) if there are sometoo variable to be aligned. When you know what sites
(bp) you are excluding you can just add that command
to your tree-building command set in PAUP or Mr-
Bayes or whatever you are using. You should report
this in your methods.

AntiEvolution Law in LA
Please read the following forwarded email about evolu-
tion education in Louisiana.
—–
From: “Barbara Forrest”
<barbara.forrest@gmail.com >Date: June 18, 2008
11:08:42 AM PDT Subject: Help needed immediately
for Louisiana
You all no doubt know what is happening down here.
We have the point at which the only possible measure
we have left is to raise an outcry from around the coun-
try that Gov. Jindal has to hear. He won’t respond,
but we have to at least make some noise. What is hap-
pening in Louisiana has national implications, much to
the delight of the Discovery Institute.
SB 733, the LA Science Education Act, has passed both
houses of the legislature and the governor has indicated
that he intends to sign it. But we don’t have to be quiet
about this. There is something that you and everyone
else you know who wants to help can do: The LA Coali-
tion for Science has posted a press release and an open
letter to Jindal asking him to veto the bill. http://-
lasciencecoalition.org .
It is time for a groundswell of contacts to Jindal, and
*this must be done immediately* since we don’t know
when he will sign the bill. The vote in the legislature
is veto-proof, so any request for Jindal to veto the bill
*must stress that the governor can make this veto stick40 EvolDir July 1, 2008
if he wants it to stick*. Please contact everyone you
know and ask them to contact the governor’s oﬃce and
ask him to veto the bill. If you have a blog, blog this. If
you have friendly contacts in your address book, please
ask them to also contact the governor’s oﬃce.
The contact information is at the LCFS link above. We
want people all over the country to do this, as many as
possible. Here are the talking points:
Point 1: The Louisiana law, SB 733, the LA Science
Education Act, has national implications. So far, this
legislation has failed in every other state where it was
proposed, except in Michigan, where it remains in com-
mittee. By passing SB 733, Louisiana has set a danger-
ous precedent that will beneﬁt the Discovery Institute
by helping them to advance their strategy to get intel-
ligent design creationism into public schools. Louisiana
is only the beginning. Other states will now be encour-
aged to pass such legislation, and the Discovery Insti-
tute has already said that they will continue their push
to get such legislation passed.
Point 2: Since Gov. Jindal’s support for teaching ID
clearly helped to get this bill passed in the ﬁrst place,
his decision to veto it will stick if he lets the legislature
know that he wants it to stick.
Point 3: Simply allowing the bill to become law with-
out his signature does not absolve the governor of the
responsibility for protecting the public school science
classes of Louisiana. He must veto the bill to show that
he is serious about improving Louisiana by improving
education. Anything less than a veto means that the
governor is giving a green light to creationists to under-
mine the education of Louisianachildren.
I have given you the talking points here. You can pull
additional ones from the LCFS press release and our
online letter.
Now let’s get them out! Contact the governor. Then
contact your friends, and ask them to contract the gov-
ernor and to ask all of their friends to do the same. We
need to create a huge network of e- mails asking peo-
ple to do this. Where they live does not matter at this
point. What is happening in Louisianahas implications
for everyone in the nation.

Embedding Insects Sectioning
Dear Colleagues,
My lab is trying to do a little internal anatomy on ants,
through embedding and sectioning via microtome, but
we are having problems with the embedding method.
More speciﬁcally we cannot get the embedding medium
to solidify enough. We’ve been using two diﬀerent dur-
cupan based methods, one from Oppelt et al. 2007,
Naturwissenschaften. Even a near doubling of the hard-
ener component leaves our blocks at best like licorice.
E.g. too soft. We chose the durcupan method out of
concern for getting a block of the right hardness for our
ants (hard on the outside due to the exoskeleton, but
very soft inside).
I personally have no experience in such work, unfor-
tunately, and those social insect researchers I know to
have done such work all are based in Europe. Would
there happen to be any Lab in NY or close by (PA, MA)
doing embedding and sectioning of any sort of arthro-
pod (preferentially) that could possibly be willing to
have my MS student come and simply watch how youdo things with whatever method is working for you for
a day or two? We would very much appreciate it.

HardyWeinberg Bonferonni
Dear colleagues,
I am a new phd student and my research area is human
genetics and especially genetics of human diseases. I
would like to ask you something about the Bonferonni
correction. I have p-values of Hardy-Weinberg equilib-
rium lower than 0.05 (p <0.05)in one control population
for 3 SNPs. I would like to apply the Bonferonni cor-
rection in this population. I have seen in the literature
diﬀerent approaches for Bonferonni correction eg multi-
plying the observed p-values with total number of tests
(SNPs * populations)or dividing the statistically signif-
icant value of 0.05 with the total number of tests (SNPs
* populations tested in the study).
Which is the most suitable way for that?

KinshipRelatedness help request
Hi all,I am just beginning to analyze several populations for
relatedness/kinship. We have collected 57 individuals
(we believe this to be most of not all the individuals
of this species in this area) and genotyped them at 10
loci. For now I am only examining this one popula-
tion, but we have others. We sampled at two diﬀerent
time periods in this population. These individuals are
a fossorial rodent and we have information about which
burrow they were caught in, their sex, and age. Based
on the ﬁeld work and radio-telemetry we can infer some
maternal/pup relationships. However, I have run Kin-
ship and Relatedness without any of the ﬁeld inferred
data.
I ran multiple hypotheses in Kinship:
a) Hypothesis = full sib to unrelated rm = 0.5, rp =
0.5 with null hypothesis = rm = 0.0, rp = 0.0
b) H =f ull sib to half-sib rm=0.5, rp=0.5 and Hn =
rm = 0.5, rp = 0.0
c) H = half-sib to unrelated rm = 0.5, rp = 0.0 and Hn
= rm = 0.0, rp = 0.0
I also tried looking at “parentage”
d) H = maternal/oﬀspring to unrelated rm = 1.0, rp =
0.0 and Hn = rm = 0.0, rp = 0.0
e) H = paternal/oﬀspring to unrelated rm = 0.0, rp =
1.0 and Hn = rm = 0.0, rp = 0.0
f) I ran Relatedness in Kinship for pairwise r values
So several confusing things resulted from comparing
these results. 1) the results ﬁles for maternal/oﬀspring
and paternal/oﬀspring (d) and e) above) both have the
same exact results. The results ﬁles look exactly the
same including pairwise relationships that are signiﬁ-
cant?! Any thoughts about this?
2) We have several instances where inferring relation-
ships are very diﬃcult. For example: pairwise kinship
between individuals 1 and 2 were signiﬁcant at the 0.001
level under test a) and c) above but not signiﬁcant
under test b)???? Also the relatedness value between
these two individuals is 0.08. From comparing tests a),
b), and c) I might conclude that these two are half-sibs
but the relatedness score does not support that, right?
3) One last question, in the Kinship manual on page
9 it states“Note that Kinship cannot distinguish be-
tween types of relationships that would have the same
r values (such as mother-oﬀspring vs. maternal half-
siblings)”. I am confused by this if you can test rm =
0.5, rp= 0.0 as maternal half-sibs and run another test
as rm = 1.0, rp = 0.0 doesn’t this dinstinguish? Or is
it on the output end that it cannot distinguish, mean-
ing both relationships might be found to be signiﬁcant44 EvolDir July 1, 2008
when tested?
I am sure these are simple questions for some but I
could sure use some help and guidance. I have been
doing a lot of reading and I have concluded that the
case may be that we are asking too much of our data
and all we can say is that these individuals are closely
related rather than distinguish ﬁrst- and second-order
or parentage relationships and/or we may need to go to
CERVUS for parentage. I have also concluded that we
may be better oﬀ adding the relationships we inferred
from the ﬁeld into Kinship to get the best possible an-
swer. So, is there anyway to distinguish half-sibs from
full-sibs reliably? No one knows the breeding system
in these rodents and we would like to detect multiple
paternity if possible. Thanks to any of you who take
the time to read this much less answer me. I hope there
is someone who can light the way out of the darkness
that are these statistics!

Dear Lepidopterists et al.,
In order to make communication about common issues
more eﬀective, LepGen (a Lepidoptera genetics and ge-
nomics list serv managed by Marian Goldsmith) and
ButterﬂyBase (a Lepidoptera genome database curated
by Alexie Papanicolaou) are preparing a community
registry. The ﬁrst purpose is to populate LepGen with
as many interested parties as possible. The second pur-
pose is to create a searchable online database of all labo-
ratories working with Lepidoptera in order to facilitate
collaborations, exchange of ideas, and strengthen our
community.
Naturally, membership is open to any laboratory, re-
gardless of whether or not their primary research is on
moths and butterﬂies or other organisms.
If you have 10-15 minutes to spare please go to http:/-
/butterﬂybase.org/community/lepgen registry.php to
ﬁll out this very short survey. During the survey, you
can also opt to register with LepGen, which will con-
tinue to serve as the main mode of communication
among our group.
If you are not registered with LepGen, completing it
as soon as possible will make sure you don’t miss any
important announcements.
Many thanks!

Opponnents new strategy
Opponents of Evolution Adopting New Strategy By
LAURA BEIL Published: New York Times June 4,
2008
DALLAS Opponents of teaching evolution, in a natural
selection of sorts, have gradually shed those strategies
that have not survived the courts. Over the last decade,
creationism has given rise to “creation science,” which
became “intelligent design,” which in 2005 was banned
from the public school curriculum in Pennsylvania by
a federal judge.
Now a battle looms in Texas over science textbooks
that teach evolution, and the wrestle for control seizes
on three words. None of them are “creationism” or
“intelligent design” or even “creator.”
The words are “strengths and weaknesses.”
Starting this summer, the state education board will de-
termine the curriculum for the next decade and decide
whether the “strengths and weaknesses” of evolution
should be taught. The benign-sounding phrase, some
argue, is a reasonable eﬀort at balance. But critics say
it is a new strategy taking shape across the nation to
undermine the teaching of evolution, a way for students
to hear religious objections under the heading of scien-
tiﬁc discourse.
Already, legislators in a half-dozen states Alabama,
Florida, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri and South Car-
olina have tried to require that classrooms be open to
“views about the scientiﬁc strengths and weaknesses of
Darwinian theory,” according to a petition from the
Discovery Institute, the Seattle-based strategic center
of the intelligent design movement.
“Very often over the last 10 years, we’ve seen antievo-
lution policies in sheep’s clothing,” said Glenn Branch
of the National Center for Science Education, a groupbased in Oakland, Calif., that is against teaching cre-
ationism.
The “strengths and weaknesses” language was slipped
into the curriculum standards in Texas to appease cre-
ationists when the State Board of Education ﬁrst man-
dated the teaching of evolution in the late 1980s. It
has had little eﬀect because evolution skeptics have not
had enough power on the education board to win the
argument that textbooks do not adequately cover the
weaknesses of evolution.
Yet even as courts steadily prohibited the outright
teaching of creationism and intelligent design, cre-
ationists on the Texas board grew to a near majority.
Seven of 15 members believe in the notion of intelligent
design, and they have the blessings of Gov. Rick
Perry <http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/-
timestopics/people/p/rick perry/index.html?inline=-
nyt-per >, a Republican.
What happens in Texas does not stay in Texas: the
state is one of the country’s biggest buyers of textbooks,
and publishers are loath to produce diﬀerent versions of
the same material. The ideas that work their way into
education here will surface in classrooms throughout
the country.
“ ’Strengths and weaknesses’ are regular words that
have now been drafted into the rhetorical arsenal of
creationists,” said Kathy Miller, director of the Texas
Freedom Network, a group that promotes religious free-
dom.
The chairman of the state education board, Dr. Don
McLeroy, a dentist in Central Texas, denies that the
phrase “is subterfuge for bringing in creationism.”
“Why in the world would anybody not want to include
weaknesses?” Dr. McLeroy said.
The word itself is open to broad interpretation. If the
teaching of weaknesses is mandated, a textbook might
be forced to say that evolution has an “inability to ex-
plain the Cambrian Explosion,” according to the group
Texans for Better Science Education, which questions
evolution.
The Cambrian Explosion was a period of rapid diversiﬁ-
cation that evidence suggests began around 550 million
years ago and gave rise to most groups of complex or-
ganisms and animal forms. Scientists are studying how
it unfolded.
Evolution as a principle is not disputed in the scientiﬁc
mainstream, where the term “theory” does not mean
a hunch, but an explanation backed by abundant ob-
servation, and where gaps in knowledge are not seen as
grounds for doubt but points for future understanding.46 EvolDir July 1, 2008
Over time, research has strengthened the basic tenets
of evolution, especially as advances in molecular genet-
ics have allowed biologists to read the history recorded
in the DNA of animals and plants.
Yet playing to the American sense of fairness, lawmak-
ers across the country have tried to require that class-
rooms be open to all views. The Discovery Institute
has provided a template for legislators to ﬁle “academic
freedom” bills, and they have been popping up with in-
creasing frequency in statehouses across the country.
In Florida, the session ended last month before legisla-
tors could take action, while in Louisiana, an academic-
freedom bill was sent to the House of Representatives
after passing the House education committee and the
State Senate.

software answers
(I resend this message, as it does not seem to have been
delivered the ﬁrst time).
Thanks to all who replied to my question about
metapopulation genetics simulation software. The orig-
inal question was:
Can anybody suggest a software package for individ-
ual based metapopulation genetics simulation of diploid
organisms under diﬀerent population sizes, migration
rates, migration models and extinction-recolonisation
rates. The program should be able to output genetic
parameters at every generation (or every ten-hundred
generations). Easypop does not seem to have an option
of incorporating extinction-recolonisations.
The software packages suggested:
SimuPop - to be programmed in Phython Rmetasim
and Kernelpop - to be programmed in R Mendelsac-
countant Nemo quantiNemo simcoal2 Ecogenetics - be-
ing developed
The packages simcoal2 and quantiNemo appear to be
relatively easy to use, although in simcoal2 (and sim-
coal) making the input ﬁle work can sometimes be dif-
ﬁcult. I am currently experimenting with these two
packages and you are welcome to contact me a little
later, if you want to learn more about my experience.

It depends exactly what you want and how quickly you
need it. Over the next few months I’m going to be
developing a program to do something similar to what
you describe and I could always try incorporating the
kind of things you need (as well as making it more user-
friendly than programs I write just for my own use!).
Anyway, it might be an option to think about if it turns
out there is no oﬀ-the-shelf software that’ll do what you
need.
** there are not much simulation softwares en-
abling many evolutionary scenarios. Easypop
is indeed a good one to start, two others are
also useful (also never used them myself), namelyJuly 1, 2008 EvolDir 47
Mendelsaccountant ( http://mendelsaccountant.info/ )

Please forward me the responses you get, as I am inter-
ested to hear if any new programs exist or is in devel-
opment.
** try rmetasim and kernalpop. See Allan’s website
(http://linum.cofc.edu/software.html ). it does exactly
what you are attempting
** I have developed software to do just this. There are
two R packages on CRAN that implement 1) patchy
sites with a migration matrix and 2) continuous space
(potentially broken into patches). The former is called
rmetasim the latter, kernelpop. Both are lots more ﬂex-
ible than easypop, but with ﬂexibility comes complex-
ity. You need to use R to use the packages, though I’d
argue that learning R would be useful for lots of other
things as well. **
Regarding individual based modeling software- give
Nemo a look. It isn’t quite as ready out of the box
as you are looking for, but it can do everything you are
look for it to do.
**
quantiNEMO does exactly what you are looking for.
We just (yesterday) have it accepted by Bioinformat-
ics. Extinction - recolonization can be simulated in two
ways, either by setting an extinction rate for the popu-
lations, but in this case the extinction is random, or you
specify the extinction explicitly by setting temporar-
ily the carrying capacity of a patch to zero. The pro-
gram itself and an extensive manual can be found at
http://www2.unil.ch/popgen/softwares/quantinemo/ .
** Nemo is an individual-based, genetically and spa-
tially explicit simulation software. You can use it
to model any kind of metapopulation structure with
extinction/colonization, explicit sex- speciﬁc dispersal
matrices (or island/stepping stone/lattice models), ex-
tended choice of mating systems, etc. It implements
neutral genetic markers and deleterious mutations, for
examples of two genetic traits that are already imple-
mented.
You can save the results at any pace you want during
the simulation. The stats you can save for the neutral
markers are F-stats (Gst & Theta), coancestries, het-
erozygosities, allelic diversity, Nei’s D, etc. Plus you
can save the population genotypes in FSTAT ﬁle for-
mat for subsequent analysis.

Context:
It is increasingly appreciated that functional traits of
plant species drive the functioning of ecosystems and
the services ecosystems provide to humans. Functional
traits are the result of millions of years of evolution,
with diﬀerent traits prevailing in diﬀerent phylogenetic
lineages, and local plant communities can be assembled
from many or few lineages. At the scale of island ﬂoras
it has been shown that phylogenetic structure of ﬂo-
ras indeed eﬀects functioning, from trait evolution to
ecosystem level processes. We suggest that the same
applies to local communities in diﬀerent types of envi-
ronments: Phylogenetic diversity of plant communities
may determine their functioning. Moreover, phyloge-
netic diversity may respond to anthropogenic impacts,
in particular ongoing nitrogen pollution. Phylogenetic
diversity may thus be a common denominator to detect
impacts of humans and understand their consequences
on ecosystem services. We are going to study three ma-
jor aspects, each of them being new to science. For each
of the aspects a wealth of data and material is already
available within a CNRS-funded Action Th´ ematique
(ATIP) project on the Ecology of Diversiﬁcation.
Subjet
Hypotheses
(Q.1) Evolutionary consequences of phylogenetic di-
versity of communities: Do a species functional traits
depend on whether its neighbors are phylogenetically
closely or distantly related? Closely related plant
species may compete more strongly, and exchange more
natural enemies, than distantly related species. In that
case, a species should shift its traits more strongly
where it co-exists with closely related species, and it
should be better defended against natural enemies.
(Q.2) Ecosystemic consequences of phylogenetic diver-
sity of communities: Is phylogenetically diverse plant
litter decomposed more quickly than phylogenetically
clustered litter? (Q.3) Anthropogenic drivers of phy-
logenetic diversity of communities: Does nitrogen pol-
lution change the phylogenetic diversity of plant com-
munities and of decomposers in the plant litter? Ni-
trogen is a key resource in ecosystems that is currently
in over-supply across much of the Bretagne region and
the rest of Europe, triggering increased competitive dis-
placements of species.
The major steps of the thesis
For (Q.1) we will study early successional communi-
ties, meadows (proﬁting from an already established
prime biodiversity experiment at Jena with already es-
tablished cloning and cultivation) and in late succes-
sional communities, forests (proﬁting from a researchproject on oak crowns situated within phylogenetically
more or less closely related canopies).
For (Q.2) we will explore how the phylogenetic position
of plant species correlates to the phylogenetic position
of their decomposers, using meta-analyses of published
studies. We will also study whether litter of phyloge-
netically diverse plant communities is colonized by phy-
logenetically diverse sets of decomposers, and whether
decomposition and nitrogen mineralization is quicker
in such communities, based on unique data bases for
the R´ egion Bretagne. Moreover, we will establish, for
the ﬁrst time, experimental litter communities across
multiple phylogenetic scales.
For (Q.3) we will consider data bases of R´ egion Bre-
tagne combined with assessments of phylogenetic struc-
ture and speed of decomposition. We will use geostatis-
tical approaches to test how a surplus input of nitrogen
across the Bretagne shifts the phylogenetic structure of
the vegetation, and its related decomposer faunas. This
will permit to test contrasting theories on

have a Linnaeus module. Linnaeus had a live cot-
ton top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus) as a pet (there
is even a portrait of his monkey!). He (my friend,
not Linnaeus) would be interested in using a stuﬀed
cotton top tamarin. If anybody is aware of any in-
dividual that could potentially be sent and lent for
that use, that would be great. For any question (will
they harm the poor animal?), please do not hesitate
to either contact me (chikhi@igc.gulbenkian.pt) or him
(tcarvalho@igc.gulbenkian.pt). This is relatively ur-
gent since the exhibition will be run at the Gulbenkian

Rotting fruit samples for
Caenorhabditis
Dear all,
This is a call for rotting fruit samples from all around
the world (especially outside Western Europe and US-
Canada) to ﬁnd Caenorhabditis species.
Caenorhabditis nematodes proliferate in rotting fruits
that have fallen on soil below their tree (and are also
found on snails, isopods, etc. that probably carry
them to the fruits - cf. Barriere and Felix, Genetics
2007). Curiously pretty much the same as Drosophila
and yeasts.... In the past years, 8 new Caenorhabditis
species were found - in China, Portugal, US, Ghana,
India, La Reunion and Guyana. With other colleagues,
we also study the distribution and genetic structure of
the diﬀerent species, so we are also interested in getting
the “old” ones, like C. elegans or C. briggsae. From
the recent surge in new species since we sample rotting
fruits, we are probably very far from exhausting the
diversity of species around the world.
If you or somone you know are living or trav-
eling outside of “Western” Europe (mostly
France/UK/Germany; even Ireland, Italy or Scan-
dinavia need sampling!) and US/Canada, I would
be interested that you sample rotting fruits /vegeta-
bles/ﬂowers (either wild or cultivated, below their
tree). Samples of about 10-20 ml are good. They need
to travel in aerated containers so that they don’t start
fermenting and depleting the oxygen, for example in
plastic bags or 10-50 ml tubes which are not airtight
(cap slightly unscrewed, or small hole in it). I could
get worms out after 2-3 weeks of travel, provided they
are not heated too much.
Note there is a prize for ﬁnding a sister species50 EvolDir July 1, 2008
to C. elegans (cash + the right to propose a
name). http://www.wormbase.org/mt/wormbase/-

sample, you’ll get it....

Sequencing problems answers
Dear all,
A couple of months ago I sent an email reporting rather
frustrating sequencing problems. It appears we have
found the source: The UV light box for cutting bands!
When we narrowed down the problem to the gel cutting
stage we proceeded by sequencing directly from a puri-
ﬁed PCR product (even though we often get unspeciﬁc
bands). The sequences were mostly ok, of course this
protocol was no good for cloning. During our further
investigations we found out that someone changed the
light bulb around the time we had the ﬁrst problems.
Although the bulb hasn’t been replaced yet it appears
that cutting bands from Ethidium bromide gels is more
productive than a cheap cyber green stain that we have
started using in February. We also keep the UV expo-
sure to an absolute minimum!

Software BayesianSerialCoalescence
Subject: Bayesian Serial Coalescence
We have released a new version of Serial SimCoal with
bayesian analysis capabilities. This means that rather
than specifying set paramter values for the model sim-
ulations, users can now specify a prior distribution of
values, and compare the simulation results to actual
data to derive posterior probability distributions for
those parameters. Like previous versions, this program
is backwards compatible with all prior versions of Sim-
Coal and will run input ﬁles created for those versions
(including those written by Excoﬃer, not by us). Users
can specify population structure, historical events, and
use samples of many diﬀerent ages (aDNA supported).
Data can be microsat, RFLP or sequence. Summary
statistics of each run are returned, along with para-
mater values.
The package is available for MacOS and PC, and can
be found along with the users manual and source code
athttp://iod.ucsd.edu/simplex/ssc/BayeSSC.htm

Software DAMBE and VISTA
Dear All,
I just tried DAMBE on the Windows VISTA platform
and did not experience any problem. Those who have
experienced problems please let me know the details.
Here is what I did:
1. Upgraded to Windows VISTA from a PC with Win-
dows XP and DAMBE already installed. After upgrad-
ing to VISTA, DAMBE runs ﬁne.
2. Did a clean installation of Windows
VISTA on a PC and then installed DAMBE
5.0.15 at http://dambe.bio.uottawa.ca/-
dambe installation instructions.asp . I experienced
no problem during installation. I run functions with
sequence alignment, distance-based, maximum parsi-
mony and maximum likelihood phylogenetic methods
and encountered no problem. (There is one point
during installation when I was asked if I should allow
the DAMBE installation to run. I click the ’Allow’
button and everything went ﬁnd.)
One minor diﬀerence between Windows XP and Win-
dows Vista is that Microsoft XML parser is part of
the VISTA so one does not need to click and install
msxml6.msi.
(I will begin to register DAMBE users so that I do not
have to email updates to the entire EvolDir).

Software DAMBE update
Dear All,
Due to popular requests, I have just added to DAMBEthe genetic distance based on the GTR (General time
reversible) substitution model. To use it, open an
aligned sequence ﬁle in virtually any standard for-
mat, click ’Phylogenetics |Distance methods |Nucleotide
sequences’. In the dropdown list box labelled ’Genetic
distance’, choose ’GTR’ (the default is TN93), and click
the ’Run’ button.
I have also modiﬁed the interface slightly and improved
the format of the output.

Software SitewiseTreeﬁnder
Another unpaid TREEFINDER version is online at:
www.treeﬁnder.de TREEFINDER is a software to
compute phylogenetic trees from molecular sequences.
New features are:
- user-deﬁnable substitution model: MAP - computa-
tion of sitewise rates - automatic generation of data
partitions
MAP is a class of general time-reversible sub-
stitution models mapping characters to states as
deﬁned by the user. Multiple characters may
represent one state. MAP deﬁnitions, such as e.g.
MAP[“AGPST”,“C”,“DENQ”,“FWY”,“HKR”,“ILMV”],
can be stored in variables and then be used as building
blocks of more complex models. All parameters
can be estimated. The MAP can be fed into any
function that takes substitution models, including tree
reconstruction, hypothesis testing, model selection,
sequence simulation.
The computation of sitewise rates replaces the old rate
proﬁle tool.
Based on the sitewise rates one can now divide a se-
quence alignment into partitions of slower and faster
evolution.
Please note that I am still not being paid for my work
and that I had no income for years. I wonder if some-
body ﬁnds TREEFINDER worth oﬀering me a com-
pensation, a wage, a position, a perspective. I wonder

Software Spidermonkey
Dear Evoldir,
We would like to introduce the community to Spider-
monkey, a new web application that we are hosting at
http://www.datamonkey.org . Spidermonkey uses phy-
logenetic and Bayesian network methods to detect co-
evolving sites in an alignment of nucleotide, codon, or
protein sequences. Inference of site coevolution is based
on the overlap of substitution events in the tree. Substi-
tutions are inferred by maximum likelihood reconstruc-
tion of ancestral sequences, which can be resampled in
order to quantify uncertainty in reconstruction.
Spidermonkey is completely free and operates on our
80-processor Linux cluster. It is based on methods that
we also distribute freely as a stand-alone application
within our open-source phylogenetic software package
HyPhy ( http://www.hyphy.org ).
For further details, please refer to http://-
www.datamonkey.org/help/spidermonkey.php .
Sincerely yours, - Art Poon.

SouthAfrica FieldVolunteers
Volunteer needed as ﬁeld assistants for the project:
Socio-Ecology of small Mammals in the Succulent Ka-
roo of South Africa
>From mid August onwards
Project: We study the reasons of group living, pater-
nal care, communal nesting and social ﬂexibility in the
striped mouse. As this species is diurnal and the habi-tat is open, direct behavioral observations in the ﬁeld
are possible.
What kind of people are needed? Biol-
ogy/zoology/veterinary students with a BSC/
Vordiplom or equivalent are preferred as candi-
dates. Applicants must have an interest in working in
the ﬁeld and with animals. Hard working conditions
will await applicants, as the study species gets up
with sunrise (between 5 and 6 o‘ clock), and stops
its activity with dusk (19 o‘ clock). Work during
nights might also be necessary. Work in the ﬁeld
will be done for 5-6 days a week. Applicants must
be able to manage extreme temperatures (below 0 at
night, sometimes over 40C during days). Applicants
must both be prepared to live for long periods in the
loneliness of the ﬁeld and to be part of a small group.
Work of ﬁeld assistants: Trapping and marking of mice
and rats; radio-tracking to determine home ranges and
nest sites; direct behavioral observations in the ﬁeld; ex-
periments and observations with captive specimen un-
der natural weather conditions; maintenance and clean-
ing of the research station.
Conﬁrmation letter: Students get a letter of conﬁrma-
tion about their work and can prepare a report of their
own small project to get credit points from their uni-
versity for their bachelor or masters studies.
Costs: Students have to arrange their transport to the
ﬁeld site themselves. Per month, an amount of Rand
750 (around 65 Euro) must be paid for accommoda-
tion at the research station. Students must buy their
own food etc in Springbok (costs of about R 2000 or
170 Euro/month). Including extras, you should expect
costs of about 250 Euros per month. Students get an
invitation letter which they can use to apply for funding
in their home country (eg. DAAD in Germany, SANW
in Switzerland).
Place: The ﬁeld site is in the Goegap Nature Reserve
near Springbok in the North-West of South Africa. The
vegetation consists of Succulent Karoo, which has been
recognized as one of 25 hotspots of biodiversity. It is a
desert to semi-desert with rain mainly in winter (June
to September).
When and how long: Currently we are looking for one
volunteer to start middle of August, two volunteers to
start beginning of September and two to star begin-
ning of December. Volunteers are expected to stay at
least 2 months, but longer periods of up to 6months are
preferred.
How to apply? Send a short motivation letter stating
why and for which period you are interested and your

spiking RealTimePCR
Dear EvolDir members,
I am using real-time PCR to quantify gene expression
in non-model species (Apodemus sp., Marmosops sp.).
RNA is extracted from spleen and liver samples stored
in RNA-later. Currently I try to ﬁnd and validate ap-
propriate house-keeping genes. To control for reverse
transcription eﬃciencies I wanted to spike my samples
with an artiﬁcial RNA. I transcribed a known sequence
successfully into RNA via T7 transcription and added it
into my RT-reaction, but unfortunately I failed to am-
plify this reference in my real-time PCR with speciﬁc
primers.
What I am asking for is experiences with spiking. Is
there someone who has a good artiﬁcial external ref-
erence he can recommend or a good protocol, tips or
tricks that might help?
Thanx and all the best!

the particular challenges and opportunities associated
with, or sharing ideas and strategies for, teaching evo-

ganized group (support group?) to discuss these issues
on a more routine basis. If anyone is interested in meet-
ing, please feel free to send me your name and contact
information so we can try to connect; or if enough peo-
ple respond I will ﬁgure something out so we can all get
together during the conference.
Thanks in advance, and I look forward to meeting you

UV for sterilization answers
I received a number of answers regarding the UV ster-
ilisation of PCR and extraction reagents. Many people
advocated the use of ﬁlter tips and small aliquots of
reagents but the actual use of UV received a variety of
responses;
I used UV sterilization to avoid a persistent contam-
ination in our lab.I sterilise pipettes, tips, tubes and
water under UV for 20 min. Then Iperform my PCR
adding everything (primers, dNTPs, water, Mg) but the
Taqand DNA and then I sterilise the master mix for 10
min. Then add Taq andDNA. With this protocol I man-
age to avoid the contamination. The amountof PCR
product was a bit lower than without the UV treatment
but it wasgood enough.I never tried to sterilise the Taq
but I’m not sure is a good idea. WithdNTPs there is
not any problem and with primers there is not problems
ifthey don’t have several T together (they could form
T dimers, that caninhibit the PCR).I send you a paper
with some information about UV sterilization (Padua

I wouldn’t expose dNTPs to UV light. UV light ex-
cites DNA. In yourcells, UV light causes mutations and
cancer. We use UV light to“sterilize” things used in
pcr because it damages DNA. ad dNTPs arethe com-
ponents of DNA, they are also likely to be damaged by
UV light. I don’t know about the enzymesbestdiana
Hi Claire, I would suggest several things:
Using a negative control (no DNA added) for each
PCR will alert you to possible cross contamination. If
available, using ﬁlter tips will help to minimize cross-
contamination. Cleaning your work space and pipettes
daily, and making small aliquots (single or a few uses)
of your reagents (dNTPs, primers, water, etc) will also
help to minimize risk of contamination.
You can order small bottles of double distilled water (if
this is not available to you at your institution) for re-
suspending primers and for making your master mix (if
you order PCR kits, they often come with clean water).
You mentioned sterilizing your Taq and dNTPs and
this strikes me as not necessary at all. These two
reagents should not be left at room temperature (espe-
cially Taq!) for any length of time (I always keep mine
in the -20C freezer at all times in a enzyme cooler) and
they should arrive free of any DNA (especially free of
the DNA you are working with and are concerned with).
So exposing them to UV light seems unnecessary.
Good luck! Nikki Freed nicole.freed@env.ethz.ch
Best and safest thing to do is to use separate sets
of tips, pipettes,reagents, etc. in diﬀerent rooms for
all pre-PCR reactions. I’ve heard(and read) it was
not good to UV-sterilise PCR tubes, as plastic suf-
fersfrom it, and I’ve never UV-sterilised reagents. Ti-

hibits PCRAuthor(s): Burgess, LC; Hall, JOSource:

Hi Claire,UV sterilizing enzymes will kill them so that
is not a good idea.You should try to ﬁnd a hood some-
where else (i.e. in a lab that doesnot work on this
species or anything related). It is also best if you dothe
work in a building or part of the building that does
not share thesame ventilation system. Basically, mu-
seum specimens are consideredabout the same as “an-
cient DNA” so you really need to use the same sortsof
precautions. This includes using extraction and PCR
blanks to testyour reagents, ordering all reagents, gloves
etc. separately (and do nottake them into the lab where
the modern specimens are), and avoidinggoing into the
modern lab before you go to the other lab to work on
themuseum specimens. It might also be best to do
the museum work ﬁrst.Finally, depending on the age ofthe museum specimens, you might need todesign your
primers such that they amplify short (100-200 bp) frag-
ments. Good luck!Anne
UV treatment of liquid reagents in a hood (with a UV
bulb) is not an idealsterilization method - as i under-
stand it, certain kinds of plastic blockUV rays, and UV
of this strength can only penetrate in liquid a very
shortdistance - maybe a centimetre at best (imagine
how colours change underocean waters - and that’s full-
strength solar power!). You’re basicallyjust wasting
energy and time. And blasting chemicals with bond-
breakingrays makes me nervous. For reagent steril-
ization, 0.2 micron ﬁlter units are best - you can use-
large ﬁlter units for larger volumes (250ml+) and sy-
ringe ﬁlters forsmaller volumes. However, I’ve worked
with herbarium specimens also, and with good ster-
iletechnique, had no cross-contam problems. Remem-
ber that most molecularreagents come pre-sterilized, so
re-treating them has more potential tointroduce

The Molecular Ecology and Fisheries Genetics Labora-
tory (MEFGL) is a leading research division within the
School of Biological Sciences’ (SBS) Molecular Ecology
and Evolution Group, one of the largest research areas
within the University. A central part of our work is the
application of molecular markers such as microsatel-
lites, AFLPs, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
and sequence data (454 and Sanger) to fundamental
evolutionary and ecological questions relating to the
origins, levels, distribution and ecological signiﬁcance of
genetic variation in wild populations. The MEFGL, to-
gether with other members of the Molecular Ecology &
Evolution Group, has recently moved into the purpose-
built research suite embedded within the newly built £8

CornellU Speciation
Postdoctoral position in behavioral evolutionary genet-
ics and speciation P.I. : Dr. Kerry Shaw, Cornell Uni-
versity, Ithaca, NY
A postdoctoral position is available to join an NSF-
funded project to examine the genetic basis of natu-
rally occurring variation in male signal and female mate
preference behavior among closely related species of the
Hawaiian cricket genus Laupala. While ecologically and
morphologically similar, species are easily distinguished
by the pulse rates of the male calling song and female
acoustic preference. Divergence in acoustic signaling
traits is thought to play a large role in the rapid speci-
ation of this genus. Two focal species, L. paranigra and
L. kohalensis, show large diﬀerences in the pulse rate ofJuly 1, 2008 EvolDir 57
the male calling song and associated female preference.
Biometrical and quantitative trait loci mapping in the
focal species indicate that these behaviors are under the
genetic control of many loci.
Research Project: The post doc will employ genomic
resources to ﬁnely map the location of trait and pref-
erence loci using hybrid introgression lines and BAC
libraries, in order to test alternative hypotheses about
the genetic architecture of behavioral evolution and
speciation. The successful candidate will be expected to
contribute to this collaborative project while develop-
ing complementary projects of an independent nature.
Additional background: A comparative phylogenetic
framework also exists in which to understand behav-
ioral evolution in this genus. Laupala represents a por-
tion of a larger radiation of endemic Hawaiian trigo-
nidiine crickets that is conspicuously characterized by
frequent speciation and acoustic signaling evolution. In
Laupala, DNA data suggest that the current radiation
began on the oldest island where the genus is presently
found (Kauai, 5 mya), and radiated into younger is-
land habitats as those islands appeared within the last
5 million years. These data also show that speciation
has occurred both within and between islands and that
species ranges are limited to single islands. Commu-
nities of Laupala occur on all the major Hawaiian Is-
lands and convergent patterns of song evolution among
islands, and displaced evolutionary patterns within is-
lands are evident. The two focal species of this study
are each endemic to the Big Island of Hawaii and are
very closely related. The phylogenetic structure pro-
vides a recent evolutionary context in which to study
the evolution of genes and behavior.
Requirements: The desired candidate will possess an
interest in / experience with a number of bench skills
(such as DNA/RNA extraction, PCR, cDNA synthe-
sis, cloning). An interest in the evolution of premating
isolation and speciation, and the neurological basis of
behavior would be beneﬁcial.
Cornell University has several labs dedicated to the
study of evolutionary genetics, speciation genetics, evo-
lutionary basis of behavior and neuroethology. As such,
it provides a rich academic environment for those inter-

lations with plastic life histories, using physiologically
structured population models.
*Project description*
Population persistence is notably conditioned by the
degree of individual variation in reproductive success,
which depends on variation in any part of the life cycle.
Yet, the majority of studies that examined population
extinction have tended to ignore life history variation
and plasticity. Here, we wish to use life history mod-
els to inform the dynamics of small populations and
ask how plasticity in life history traits inﬂuences ex-
tinction dynamics. Many aspects of life history can
interact with population dynamics and the project con-
centrates on three of them, namely growth, maturation
and survival. The post-doc will explore this issue by
developing models that account for variation in life his-
tory traits using the theory of physiologically structured
populations (PSP). This theory takes into account that
physiological development (e.g. growth, maturation)
depends on the current state of the environment (e.g.,
temperature, food and predator densities). In turn, the
inﬂuence of the population on the environment closes
a feedback loop between environment, population and
life history. The theory of PSP models is thus particu-
larly well-suited to study the interaction between pop-
ulation dynamics and plastic life history. Small popula-
tions are subject to stochastic ﬂuctuation in abundance.
The project aims to study the feedback of this variabil-
ity on life history and the consequences for extinction
dynamics. The models will be parameterized with esti-
mates from ﬁeld and experimental studies undertaken
with the common lizard, a species with strong thermal
and food plasticity in life history traits.
The post-doc will be based at the Ecology & Evolu-
tion Lab (CNRS, UMR 7625) at the Ecole Normale
Sup´ erieure (CERES-ERTI) in Paris, where the ap-
plicant will work with /David Claessen/ and /Jean-
Fran¸ cois Le Galliard/. This post-doc project is part of a
research network on the dynamics of small populations
funded by ANR from 2008 to 2012 and will therefore in-
teract with a larger group of researchers. The post can
start on *October 1st* or *November 1st* 2008 and
will run for one year with a possible one year extension
by applying to extended funding from the R2DS net-
work in spring 2009. Gross salary will be 2500 EUR

TREE GENETIC DIVERSITY AND ADAPTATION
IN THE GUIANA SHIELD
keywords: population genetics - evolution - forest ecol-
ogy
In the context of the study of the adaptation of nat-
ural populations to global change and of the mecha-
nisms controlling their interactions with the environ-
ment, there is a growing interest in the analysis of func-
tional genetic diversity.
Tropical rainforests are among the most diverse ecosys-
tems in the world. The genetic mechanisms of the adap-
tation of tropical forest trees to their environment may
have a major role in the building up of forest commu-
nities and in their ability to respond to environmental
changes, including anthropogenic pressure and climate
change. Nevertheless, these mechanisms are just start-
ing to be elucidated by a three-pronged approach in-
cluding phylogeographic studies, quantitative genetics,
and the characterisation and isolation of genes poten-
tially involved in the response to environmental con-
straints. Several genes potentially relevant in this con-
text have already been isolated in our laboratory, in
particular for functions such as the responses to drought
and mechanical stresses; the isolation of genes involved
in response to ﬂooding is under way, and development-
related genes (wood formation, bud burst) are expected
to be isolated soon. In parallel, phylogeographic stud-
ies are disclosing the historical patterns of diversity
across the Amazonian basin, and experimental quan-
titative trait studies are being performed in order to
break apart the environmental and genetic components
of these traits.
The proposed program aims to (i) the cloning of com-
plete cDNA regions from the genes listed above and
the isolation of their promoters, (ii) the characterisa-
tion of the distribution of their diversity at the pop-
ulation, landscape and phylogeographic scale (iii) the
assessment selective pressure at these genes (iv) the
identiﬁcation of concordances and discordances of the
distribution of adaptive genetic diversity with histori-
cal patterns, as determined by neutral markers, and (v)
the identiﬁcation of concordances and discordances of
the distribution of adaptive genetic diversity with eco-
logical trends, as determined by climatic and ﬂoristic
data. The proposed program will be carried out on aselected subset of species covering a range of geograph-
ical distribution and ecological patterns (Eperua spp.,
Carapa spp.,Virola spp. and Symphonia spp.). The se-
quence data thus obtained will be analysed by methods
that take simultaneously into account population di-
vergence, gene ﬂow and selection in order to obtain the
combined estimation of all parameters. This study will
be backed up by parallel analyses on the distribution
of genetic diversity at neutral markers and by experi-
ments of reciprocal transplants among provenances and
among environments.

The newly created Institute for Genomes Sciences
(IGS) at the University of Maryland, School of
Medicine is in a period of rapid expansion with many
new appointments anticipated in the next ﬁve years.
The Institute is led by Claire M. Fraser-Liggett, Ph.D.,
one of the world1s preeminent genome scientists and
previous Director and President of the Institute for Ge-
nomic Research (TIGR). The Institute for Genome Sci-
ences houses an inter-disciplinary, multi-departmental
team of collaborative investigators with a broad spec-
trum research program related to the genomics of infec-
tious disease agents, human microbial metagenomics,
functional genomics, and bioinformatics. The impact

stantial, with more than 500 publications during thepast 15 years that have been cited more than 30,000
times.
A POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW position is open in
Joana Silva1s group at the IGS for an enthusiastic,
highly motivated individual interested in studying eu-
karyotic genome evolution. Potential projects include
the evolution of nucleotide composition of genomes,
the genomic distribution of substitution rates and the
impact of genomic location on nucleotide composition
and evolutionary rate. Projects will be mostly com-
putational and are based on the sequenced genomes
of over a dozen apicomplexans, including eight Plas-
modium, three Theileria and three Cryptosporidium
species, the causative agents of malaria, cryptosporid-
iosis, and theileriosis and East Coast fever, respectively
(http://www.igs.umaryland.edu/˜jcsilva ).
The ideal candidate will have a doctoral degree in Ge-
netics, Evolution, Computational Biology or a related
ﬁeld, will be thoroughly familiar with the ﬁelds of pop-
ulation genetics, molecular evolution and bioinformat-

UmeaU Evolution at RangeMargins
A two-year post-doc position is available to study the
limits to evolution at range margins. More speciﬁcally
the research will try to answer when and why adapta-
tions to climate change succeed or fail. The focus will
be on genetic variation in populations located at either
the range margin or the center of a species distribution.
The candidate is expected to analyze genetic variation
of populations using DNA-based markers, but the re-
search will also include genetic variation in quantitative
characters. Previous experience with molecular meth-

Post Doc position in spatial population dynamics,
Ume˚ a University, Sweden Ref no 315-2175-08
A post-doc position (2 years) in the project “Spatial
heterogeneity, functional responses and predator-prey
dynamics” is available.
It is widely believed that spatial heterogeneity stabilizes
predator-prey interactions, but the underlying mech-
anisms are poorly understood. This project focuses
on a previously overlooked aspect - the dynamics of
the covariance between predator and prey densities.
The project involves cooperation with an international
group of researchers that contribute with extensive data
sets on predator-prey systems. The data involve a di-
verse set of organisms, including insects, mites, crus-
taceans, polychaets and mammals. Many of the sys-
tems show cycles and complex spatial patterns, e.g.,
“hide and seek” dynamics.
The project is demanding but will likely yield publica-
tions in high ranked journals. A paper that provides
a background is found in Am. Nat. 167:246-259. For
more information about the project, go to <http://-
www.emg.umu.se/ >www.emg.umu.se, or contact Pro-

* Topic Understanding the relationships between dif-
ferent species may have consequences both at practical
level (e.g., history of a pathogen agent involved in a
disease), and at fundamental level (e.g., construction
of the tree of life: ﬁnding the history of all organisms).
The study of evolution requires various and numerous
pieces of data such as morphological characteristics of
a set of specimens or, more importantly, genomic and
proteomic sequences of a group of species, functional
and structural annotations. For several years now,
there has been an avalanche of data available. Com-
bining and integrating masses of phylogenomics data is
of parmount importance for better understanding evo-
lution.
* Background More speciﬁcally, this subject is part of
two projects, pPOD and Microbiogenomics.
** On the one hand, pPOD is an international project,
in which data are collected throughout the world by re-
search groups having distinct interests (specialized on
diﬀerent groups of species). Data collected by those
various groups are available in a variety of formats (re-
lational, tabulated ﬁles, and so on.).
** On the other hand, partners of the the French
project “ANR masses de donnees” Microbiogenomics
study evolution by building phylogenetic trees based
on families of proteins, part of their data is currentlyJuly 1, 2008 EvolDir 67
stored in ﬂat-ﬁles format (trees) and within a relational
warehouse (sequences, annotations).
In both projects, phylogenetists need to ask complex
questions involving all the data, both produced and
consumed by the various steps of the generation and
analysis of phylogenetic trees, including the trees them-
selves or families of trees. Examples of queries include:
What are the diﬀerences between those two trees? If I
modify the alignment by adding gaps, what would be
the impact on the ﬁnal generated tree¿‘ or
”Among the available trees, what are the subtrees
whose proteins are all involved in a given metabolic
pathway? Which are the protein modules appearing in
trees in which a given group of species is monophyletic¿‘
* Work The aim of this work is to enable various phy-
logenetists to make use of all these data in a uniﬁed
way, in the context of a relational database. One of the
main challenges lies in that the relational model does
not ﬁt with hierarchical (tree-based) data.
As a ﬁrst step, queries frequently asked by major pPOD
and Microbiogenomics partners should be identiﬁed.
Queries may be increasingly complex and can be ex-
pressed using diﬀerent kinds of language (relational al-
gebra, SQL and so on). In particular, queries may in-
volve families of trees, comparison and clustering algo-
rithms, and topological features of the trees.
A classiﬁcation of queries should then be proposed.
The third step would consist in exploring the limita-
tions of current relational standards (latest versions
of SQL) to represent phylogenetic data and express
queries. This study should provide the building blocks
for a more expressive high-level query language.

UppsalaU EvolutionaryGenomicsPostdoctoral research fellowship in evolutionary ge-
nomics at Uppsala University, Sweden
A postdoctoral fellowhip is available at the Department
of Evolutionary Biology at Uppsala University. The
postdoc is in the research-group of Dr. Hanna Johan-
nesson, and will focus on the evolution of the mating-
type chromosome in the ﬁlamentous ascomycete Neu-
rospora tetrasperma. The fellowhip is for one year, with
a high likelihood of extension.
Recent studies have revealed that chromosomal regions
controlling sexual identity in the fungal kingdom share
features with the more complex sex chromosomes of
algae, plants and animals. Our group have combined
gene divergence data, classical genetics and phyloge-
netics to show that the mating-type chromosome of N.
tetrasperma resemble the sex chromosomes in that re-
combination suppression involved more than one evo-
lutionary event, covers the majority of the chromosome
and is ﬂanked by distal regions with obligate crossovers.
Now, our group aims at exploring the system further by
using a bioinformatics and/or a molecular biology ap-
proach. This postdoc project could involve revealing
structural or autosomal gene inﬂuence on the recombi-
nation block, the evolutionary history of the chromo-
some in diﬀerent phylogenetic lineages of the species,
or whether divergence between the chromosomes is ac-
companied by diﬀerences in gene expression.

YaleU MosquitoImmunityEvolutionPost-doctoral Position in Evolution of Anti-malarial
Immune Genes
A post-doctoral position is available in the laboratory of
Jeﬀrey Powell in the Department of Ecology and Evo-
lutionary Biology at Yale University, eﬀective August
1st 2008 or as early as possible.
As part of the eﬀort to develop a malaria-resistant
transgenic mosquito, much attention has been devoted
to identifying immune genes that play a role in the de-
fense of Anopheles mosquitoes against malaria. Numer-
ous genes have been identiﬁed that are up-regulated in
response to Plasmodium infection, or whose suppres-
sion modiﬁes Plasmodium infection intensity. In an ef-
fort to identify those genes that play a primary role in
the Plasmodium defense of the mosquito and whose ef-
fects are speciﬁc to malaria, the Powell lab is investigat-
ing the population genetics of anti-malarial candidate
genes in several groups of African malaria vectors.
This work is based on the observation that Plasmod-
ium and Anopheles show clear signs of co-evolution. By
studying the genetic variation in the candidate genes in
natural populations of malaria vectors and their non-
transmitting siblings, we can identify genes that show
evidence of adaptation in malaria vectors, but not in
the closely related species that do not transmit Plas-
modium.
For more information please contact Jeﬀrey Powell.

Topics in Computational Biology
This is a one week course (8-12.9.2008) taught by Ist-
van Miklos and Jotun Hein in Budapest, Hungary. It
is aimed a researchers/students with a strong quan-
titative background (mathematics, physics, statistics,
computer science,) that wants an overview of compu-
tational biology with a wish to do research in the area.
Each day is devoted to a topic. Each day has 2 90 min-
utes lectures, 1 90 minutes computer practical and ends
with a 90 minute presentation/criticism/discussion of
two projects one practical (data analysis) and one
theoretical. Examples of projects can be found at
http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/genome/projects, the set of
projects will be expanded before September. Prepara-
tion of the project discussion will take 4-8 hours prepa-
ration. Beyond this the course should be self-contained.

provide training in conceptual and practical aspects of
data analysis for the conservation genetics of natural
and managed populations. Emphasis will be on in-
terpretation of output from recent novel statistical ap-
proaches and software programs. The course also will
allow daily discussions among young researchers and
top-researchers to help develop the next generation of
conservation geneticists, and to identify developments
needed to improve data analysis approaches. This
course will cover analysis methods including the coales-
cent, Bayesian, approximate Bayesian, and likelihood-
based approaches.
Who should apply: Ph.D. students, post-docs, and pop-
ulation biologists with a background of at least one
semester university-level course in population genetics
and a course in population ecology. Applicants must
have a basic background in population genetic data
analysis, including testing for Hardy-Weinberg propor-July 1, 2008 EvolDir 73
tions and gametic disequilibrium. Participation will
be limited to 20 people allowing eﬃcient instruction
with hands-on computer exercises during the course.
Priority will be given to persons with their own data
to analyze (for example graduate students at the end
of their degree program).Deadline for application is 15
July, 2008
Course/Workshop Format: For each subject, we pro-
vide 30-45 minutes of background, theory, discussion
and introduction to concepts. Immediately following,
we will conduct data analyzes together for 30-60 min-
utes using relevant software programs and real data
sets. Evening hands-on computer sessions and hous-
ing together of instructors and students in the same
location will allow for extensive exchange and facilitate
learning.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
