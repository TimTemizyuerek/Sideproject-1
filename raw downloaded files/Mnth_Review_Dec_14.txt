Cairns BehaviourSpeciation
Dear Colleagues,
I am pleased to announce a symposium to be presented
at the Behaviour2015 conference in Cairns, Australia,
entitled:
\ANIMAL PERSONALITY AND SPECIATION"
Theoretical and empirical results have demonstrated
the importance of considering individual personality in
elds as diverse as dispersal dynamics and social evo-
lution. Although behaviors role in speciation is well
established (e.g., sexual selection), personalitys role in
speciation remains poorly understood. The proposed
symposium will serve as an opportunity to synthesize
emerging ideas and stimulate future research into the
role of personality in speciation. The breadth of evo-
lutionary processes inuenced by personality and the
ubiquitous role of speciation suggest that this topic will
be of broad. We welcome both theoretical and empirical
studies on this topic, to be presented as oral presenta-
tions.
We welcome inquiries from parties interested in pre-
senting in this symposium. Feel free to contact the or-
ganizer, Spencer Ingley, at sjingley@byu.edu for more
information about the symposium. Formal abstracts
will be submitted through the conference abstract sub-
mission system, where you will be able to select this
symposium as your desired venue. For more informa-
tion on submitting your abstract for consideration for
this symposium, see: http://www.behaviour2015.org/-

Cairns VirtualRealitySymposium
Aug9-14
*Virtual Reality: Computer animations as a tool in ani-
mal behaviour research* Symposium at Behaviour 2015
in Cairns, Australia.
Have you ever thought about the ideal animal stimulus
in behavioural experiments?
The ideal animal stimulus is under total control of the
experimenter, has visual traits and behaviour patterns
that can be varied in any way, and produces consis-
tent test trials that can be easily repeated many times.
Sounds too far-fetched? Computer animated animal
stimuli provide the opportunity to control for all these
aspects under standardized conditions necessary to test
a given hypothesis.
Interested? Then come and join us at Behaviour 2015
conference in Cairns, Australia, where we are happy
to announce an exciting symposium organized to pro-
mote the use of computer animations in experimental
research. Although computer animations arouse lots
of interest among researchers for its advantages, many
are reluctant to use it because of seemingly big tech-
nical requirements necessary for creating animal stim-
uli, and the apparently disparate worlds of biology and
computer science. The symposium oers the possibil-
ity to demystify the process of creating animations and
to share knowledge on tools, programs, and the correct
implementation of 2-D and 3-D stimuli. Researchers al-
ready using computer animations get the opportunity
to present and discuss their current work and hence
show what is already possible.
More information about the symposium and pos-
sible speakers can be found on the symposium
webpage http://iec2015-symposium.wix.com/virtual-
reality . Please do not hesitate to contact us if you
want further information or if you want to contribute
in any way to the symposium.6 EvolDir December 1, 2014
It is already possible to register for the conference
and submit your abstract directly to our symposium
by choosing it during the submission process. De-
tails and descriptions concerning registration and ab-
stract submission can be found on the ocial con-
ference website www.behaviour2015.org <http://-

ESEB BrainEvolution
Brain evolution symposium at ESEB 2015
We would like to invite abstract submissions for the fol-
lowing symposium at next years European Society for
Evolutionary Biology:
Emerging models in evolutionary and ecological neuro-
biology
Despite their fundamental importance in animal biol-
ogy and diversication, we know little about the prox-
imate basis of ecologically relevant behaviour in wild
populations. Understanding the genetic and neural ba-
sis of behavioural evolution is of primary interest, but
also reveals mechanistic principles governing the evolu-
tion of complex phenotypes. Recent developments in
sequencing technology, methods to quantify complex
behaviour, and the application of neurological tech-
niques to more diverse organisms, have led to accel-
erated progress in this eld. A number of organisms
have attracted particular attention and are emerging
as promising model systems. Notable insights include
the identication of distinct genetic and neural modules
underpinning behaviour, the eects of gene expression
and patterning on the evolution of brain size/structure,the extent of plasticity or divergence in brain structure
between closely related species, and the nature of de-
velopmental and functional constraints acting on the
brain.
We are interested in abstracts covering a wide range of
approaches including intraspecic/experimental stud-
ies and interspecic/comparative studies, ranging from
molecular/developmental approaches through to be-
haviour, anatomy and ecology.
Details of ESEB 2015 are available here: http:/-
/www3.unil.ch/wpmu/eseb2015/ Abstract submission
and registration should open in early November.

Technological advances in the last decade strongly sug-
gest that bringing the elds of Cell Biology and Evo-
lutionary Biology together into an integrated eld of
Evolutionary Cell Biology (ECB) will dramatically in-
crease our understanding of cell biological structures,
functions, and processes, while also providing deep
insights into the mechanisms of evolutionary change.
This meeting brings together experts in evolutionary
biology, cell biology, and a range of other disciplines to
address 1) the application of evolutionary perspectives
and methodology to aid in elucidating the structure,
function and mechanisms of cellular processes, and 2)
the study of cell biological diversity to gain insight into
the mechanisms of evolution and the history of life on
earth.

SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION:
The application of evolutionary theory, methods and
experimentation to the analysis of communities of
species can facilitate our understanding of how com-
munities of species form, the processes that contribute
to their formation, and the factors that contribute
to variation both within and among such communi-
ties. For example, the application of molecular ge-
netic markers within ecological communities potentially
provides for an escape from timescale being polarised
as either ecological or evolutionary, while also provid-
ing a neutral benchmark (i.e. spatial patterns of neu-
tral genetic markers) against which to compare species-
level patterns potentially driven by non-neutral pro-
cesses.Experimental approaches can examine the inter-
action eects among species, and how these may in-
uence trait variation within and among species.The
evolutionary analysis of biological communities spans
the elds of community genetics, population genetics,
phylogeography, community phylogenetics, experimen-
tal evolution, macroecology and macroevolution. We
solicit submissions from both empirical and theoreti-
cal biologists who are interested in how communities
of species assemble, interact, and evolve over space
and time.This symposium aims to bring together re-
searchers from across dierent disciplines within evolu-
tionary biology with a focus on the analysis and under-
standing of multispecies systems.
The site for registration for the ESEB meeting and for
abstract submission for this symposium is now open
at: http://www3.unil.ch/wpmu/eseb2015/ DEAD-
LINE for abstract submission for contributed talks and
posters: 10 January 2015.
Abstracts will be evaluated by the symposium organiz-
ers and will be selected for either oral or poster presen-
tation by early March. When submitting your abstract
please state your preference (talk, poster) during the
submission process.

CooperationWithoutKinship
Aug10-14
Dear colleagues,
We are excited to invite submissions to the symposium
\Cooperation without kinship: from genomes to mutu-
alism" to be held at the 15th Congress of the European
Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB), August 10-14
2015 in Lausanne, Switzerland.
While kin selection is a powerful explanation for some
cooperation, there are many cases where relatedness
is simply not possible, such as cooperation between
species. More generally, these cases are forms of \egal-
itarian" cooperation and include examples as diverse
as genes in a genome, nuclear and organellar genomes
within cells, and species in symbiosis and mutualisms.
Without relatedness, the key hurdle in egalitarian coali-
tions is conict suppression. Conict suppression mech-
anisms have been studied in all the key examples
of egalitarian coalitions, including the suppression of
transposable elements in genomes, and cheaters in mu-
tualisms. However, these systems are rarely discussed
together.
We hope to bring together researchers from across these
diverse systems to stimulate interactions and seek gen-
eral principles underlying the evolution of egalitarian
cooperation.
We have two great invited speakers: - Toby Kiers, Vrije

\Evolutionary biology is seldom seen as a predictive
science mostly because evolutionary changes are tradi-
tionally expected to occur over long time scales where
it becomes impossible to predict evolutionary trajec-
tories. Current evidence for rapid adaptive changes
on short time scales challenges this vision and argues
for the inclusion of evolutionary responses into ecolog-
ical niche modelling of shifting species' distributions
under climate changes. Ecological forecasting of fu-
ture species' ranges has been preferred based on the
premise of conservatism of species' fundamental eco-
logical niches on the time scale of global change. The
question of niche conservatism is currently intensely de-
bated and a role for evolutionary adaptation in niche
dynamics is expected. Current niche modelling pre-
dictions of species extinctions may thus be inaccurate
whenever species have the capacity to adapt to novel
conditions outside their niche. On the other hand, evo-December 1, 2014 EvolDir 9
lutionary processes may aggravate the consequences of
environmental changes on species persistence whenever
the evolution of adaptive traits is limited by genetic
or demographic constraints. This symposium aims at
highlighting recent eorts to bring together ecological
and evolutionary approaches to better understand and
predict the potential responses of natural species to en-
vironmental changes and the impact of ongoing global
changes on the maintenance of biodiversity."

Symposium description:
Understanding the ecology and evolution of cooperation
remains one of the great challenges in biology. Why do
individuals help others at a personal cost? How do
patterns of social interaction emerge from behavioral,
evolutionary, and ecological processes? What are the
selective forces that maintain multi-species cooperative
interactions within communities?
Theory has been a vital driver in answering these and
other questions, especially when engaged with data.
Making the data-theory connections is often complex,
as cooperation is studied in the lab, the eld and the
clinic, at all levels of biological complexity, in natural
systems that range from cancerous cells and pathogenic
microbes to birds, bees and humans. Robotic and other
in silico computational systems have a potential to act
as an intermediary between the dierent approaches to
cooperation research. During the symposium we aim to
move beyond ineective debates over kin versus group
selection, and focus instead on theory as a problem-
solving tool, both fully driven by data and directly in-
forming future experiments.
Testable theoretical predictions and theoretical frame-
works based on real-world data are essential for moving
the eld forward. More than just an overview of theory,
simulations, and experiments about cooperation, at this
symposium we wish to bring together researchers who
aim to make connections between these approaches, re-
focus our joint eorts, and move the eld forward.10 EvolDir December 1, 2014

We are pleased to invite submissions for the ESEB 2015
symposium:
\EVOLUTION OF BEHAVIORAL VARIATION"
The symposium will be part of the ESEB conference
held in Lausanne (Switzerland) from August 10-14,
2015. Abstract submission deadline is due January 10,
2015. You can either apply for a talk (17 minutes in-
cluding discussion) or a poster. Further details on the
conference and about how to submit an abstract can be
found here:
http://www3.unil.ch/wpmu/eseb2015/ The goal of
this symposium is to synthesize the most recent ex-
perimental, genomic and theoretical work on individual
behavioral variation.
SYMPOSIUM ABSTRACT
During the last decade, it has become increasingly clear,
that individuals of a single species dier consistently in
behavior over time and across dierent contexts. Re-
cently, researchers started to explore the evolution of
this behavioral variation and its tness consequences,
for example in studies on animal personalities or on
behavioral castes in social animals. It also becomes ev-
ident that standardized lab experiments are valuable to
characterize dierent behavioral types whereas exper-
imental eld studies are needed to characterize their
performance in an ecological context. Moreover, ad-
vances both in statistical methods as well as in ge-
nomic tools now allow to disentangle and to identify
dierent sources of behavioral variance. We still know
little about behavioral genes and their regulatory mech-
anisms, how conserved these genes are between species
and how behavioral variance is mediated on a genetic
level. In this symposium, we plan to bring together
scientists from various disciplines to develop a broad
picture on the current research on the evolution of be-
havioral variation and its genetic underpinning.

symposium:
HOST DEFENSE IN A PARASITIZED WORLD:
SELECTION, EVOLUTION AND THE MAINTE-

SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION:
Infectious diseases are assumed to be among the most
important selective forces in nature. Yet, phenotypic
traits involved in host defense against parasites and
pathogens, and their underlying genes, often exhibit
considerable variation. This symposium aims to inte-
grate studies of selection on host defense at the pheno-
typic and molecular genetic level across diverse taxa to
advance our understanding of how defense mechanisms
evolve and how parasite- and pathogen-mediated selec-
tion can maintain variation in host defense, both at the
level of the individual and the population.
The symposium will take place during the 15th
Congress of the European Society for Evolutionary Bi-
ology (ESEB 2015, August 10-14, Lausanne, Switzer-

SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION: We are still missing
the answer to one of the important questions in evolu-
tionary biology: Why sex? Despite the high prevalence
of sexual reproduction in nature, understanding its evo-
lution and maintenance is still not that straightforward.The reason lays partly in the scarcity of experimental
tests and theory that account for ecological dynamics
and their direct consequences, i.e. population cycling
and thus changes in strength and/or direction of selec-
tion. An important step towards solving the mystery
of sex is to include ecological dynamics in experimen-
tal, theoretical as well as genomic studies. With this
proposed symposium, we hope to start a rapid grow-
ing discussion on how to further integrate the role of
ecology into the eld of the evolution of sexual repro-
duction.

Dear evoldir members,
We would like to announce the symposium evolution
and ecology of (microbial and other) ecosystems at the
ESEB 2015 conference and would like to invite abstract
submissions.
This symposium aims at showcasing recent studies and
bringing together ecological and (experimental) evolu-
tionary approaches to study the evolution of ecosys-12 EvolDir December 1, 2014
tems.
In natural systems, organisms and species evolve not
in isolation but embedded into ecosystems. Several
models describe such relationships, for example the
Red Queen and niche construction theories as well as
metabolism-based models. Such models have shown
that evolutionary processes on the ecosystem level can
be highly complex. To investigate this phenomenon
experimentally, laboratory approaches have simplied
the situation by studying evolutionary dynamics using
a (very) limited number of strains at a time under con-
trolled laboratory conditions in the powerful approach
of experimental evolution. Others studies have utilized
a more ecological approach by observing and describing
complex systems and how organisms and species can V
or cannot V co-exist over time.
Increasingly, research has been initiated that combines
these two approaches by tracking evolutionary changes
of complex ecosystems in laboratory and natural con-
ditions. Examples include studies of the dynamics
of species composition in (microbial) ecosystems over
space and time and in response to various stresses,
the evolution of social interaction between microbes,
and long-term co-evolutionary studies between dier-
ent (sets of) species or genotypes. For this symposium,
we invite submissions of experimental and theoretical
studies in this area.

SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION Our symposium fo-
cuses on the genomic complexity of adaptive evolution,
and the many associated methodological and concep-
tual challenges. Abstract submissions may, for exam-
ple, include high-quality genomic dissections of adap-
tation in natural populations; investigations of the ge-
nomic signatures of evolution under articial selection;
studies attempting to link quantitative genetics and ge-
nomics; work on the link between genomic evolution
and tness; or methodological advances in tackling sig-
natures of polygenic adaptation. We explicitly encour-
age contributions from a wide variety of taxa, and from
both the empirical and theoretical side.
SYMPOSIUM ABSTRACT The wave of genome-wide
scans for molecular signatures of adaptation is starting
to hit genetic non-model organisms. At the same time,
such analyses performed in those organisms oering the
most powerful genomic resources point to a fundamen-
tal issue in evolutionary genomics, already foreshad-
owed by a century of quantitative genetics: adaptation
is highly complex at the genomic level, with many loci
involved, most of them probably exhibiting an eect
size challenging statistical detection. The goal of this
symposium is to bring together contributions from em-pirical and theoretical genomics to address three main
questions: (i) How can our methodological toolkit be
optimized to capture the genomic complexity of adap-
tation? (ii) Where are our limits to understanding and
interpreting patterns revealed by genome scans? (iii)
How much molecular detail do we need to illuminate
for an adequate understanding of adaptive evolution?
This symposium thus has a strong methodological, con-
ceptual, and philosophical orientation. Given the enor-
mous amount of nancial and human resources cur-
rently being directed to genome scans in genetic model
and non-model systems - at the expense of more tradi-
tional evolutionary investigations - we believe that this
symposium will be of outstanding relevance to the de-
velopment of evolutionary genomics, and to evolution-
ary biology in general.

SCRIPTION:
Understanding how species adapt to heterogeneous en-
vironments is a major challenge in evolutionary biology.
In host-parasite systems, antagonistic coevolution gen-
erates highly heterogeneous selective pressures, both in
time and space.
Recently, much progress has been made to character-
ize the process of coevolution in natural (e.g., plant-
pathogen) and laboratory (e.g., phage-bacteria) pop-
ulations. This work has shown that coevolution gen-
erates strong and changing selective pressures and po-
tentially plays an important role in the dynamics and
maintenance of genetic diversity.
Yet, progress in our understanding of host-pathogen dy-
namics is hindered by several conceptual challenges and
limitations. First, one widely used approach to quan-
tify adaptation consists in transferring populations in
space or in time (local adaptation and time shift exper-
iments). Such experiments provide indirect insights on
the coevolutionary process, but their interpretation is
uneasy because of environmental heterogeneities. Sec-
ond, experimental work has revealed that the genet-
ics of the interaction may be complex, time-dependent
and environment-dependent. We lack theoretical pre-
dictions for the dynamics of coevolution in such scenar-
ios. Third, we don't know the extent to which variation
in host and parasite population sizes impact the coevo-
lutionary process (\ecological feedbacks")..
The goal of this symposium is to address these chal-

ESEB SYMPOSIUM ON GENES AND ALLELES UN-
DERLYING ADAPTATION
Dear Colleagues:
We would like to invite you to attend and/or contribute
to the ESEB symposium
'HOW TO IDENTIFY AND TEST THE LOCI AND
ALLELES UNDERLYING ADAPTATION?'
which will take place at the 15th Congress of the Euro-
pean Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB), in Lau-
sanne, Switzerland, 10 - 14 August 2015.
INVITED SPEAKERS: - Felicity Jones (FML, Max
Planck Institute, T ubingen, Germany) - Alistair Mc-
Gregor (Oxford Brookes University, Oxford, UK)
ORGANIZERS: - Paul Schmidt (University of Pennsyl-
vania) - Thomas Flatt (University of Lausanne)
SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION: To understand the
mechanisms underlying adaptation, causal molecular
variants, genes and pathways must be identied, char-
acterized and ultimately experimentally veried. To
this end, various methods for outlier detection, QTL
mapping, and association studies have provided a
wealth of 'candidates' for phenotypes of interest, the
response to articial and natural selection, and adap-
tive dierentiation within and among taxa. Recent
advances in whole-genome sequencing allow an un-
precedented, comprehensive evaluation of genotype-
phenotype associations. However, one major issue with
whole-genome screens is whether any given 'candidate'December 1, 2014 EvolDir 15
actually represents a true positive: population struc-
ture and demography, the number of independent chro-
mosomes, statistical power, and other complications
are known to generate false positives. Thus, one of
the emerging challenges in evolutionary genomics is to
unambiguously identify and empirically validate candi-
dates identied in omics-level screens. The goal of our
symposium is to discuss and showcase how to best iden-
tify and validate candidate variants, genes, and path-
ways. Specically, the symposium aims to (1) evaluate
methods by which candidates are identied and inves-
tigated; (2) generate discussion regarding the signi-
cance of functional validation of identied candidates in
quantitative, ecological and evolutionary genetics; and
(3) present some of the best current research related to
functional identication and validation.

SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION: In nature, organisms
display extreme variation for multiple aspects of pig-
mentation phenotype; this is commonly observed both16 EvolDir December 1, 2014
within and among populations, as well as among taxa.
Among populations across environmental gradients (at
the macro-physiological level), pigmentation has been
found to be associated with several tness components
such as mating ability, disease resistance, UV tolerance,
thermal adaptation, and drought tolerance. From the
molecular perspective, a number of genes and causal ge-
netic changes underlying pigmentation phenotype have
been identied in multiple taxa. The established con-
nections between molecular variation, physiology, and
tness make this trait ideally suited for addressing fun-
damental questions at the crossroads of ecology, evo-
lution and physiology. Comprehensively dening the
connections between physiological processes, pathways
and causative molecules is a major challenge in evo-
lutionary physiology. The melanin formation pathway
is a multistep and complicated process and its physi-
ological nature is poorly understood. We take advan-
tage of this symposium to address questions related to
melanism and its adaptive nature.

Dear colleagues,
We will be pleased to receive submissions for the ESEB

The symposium is part of the European Society for
Evolutionary Biology (ESEB) to be held in Lausanne,

Our goal is to bring together researchers working on the
ecology and/or genomics of polyploids, and foster new
interactions and collaborations.

SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION: Polyploidisation is a
ubiquitous feature in the evolution of plants and ani-
mals, and has been associated with changes in the phe-
notype and ecology of organisms. We currently have
a good understanding of the genomic consequences of
polyploidisation, yet, few studies have attempted to
bridge ecological and genomic analyses in polyploids.
This limitation is due, in part, to the fact that genomic
tools were not available for organisms suitable for eco-
logical studies. The rapid development of genomic tools
for non-model organisms, have dramatically changed
this situation, making possible to work on integrating
ecological and genomic studies in polyploid evolution.December 1, 2014 EvolDir 17
Our proposal is to organise a symposium, which will
bring together researchers studying the ecology and ge-
nomics of polyploids, and foster interactions and col-
laborations between groups working towards the un-
derstanding of how genomic changes during polyploidi-
sation aect the evolution of phenotypic and ecological
trait s in natural populations.

SelectionInMicrobialSystems
Aug10-14
Dear evoldir members,
We would like to announce the symposium \Groups ver-
sus individuals: levels of selection in microbial systems"
at the upcoming ESEB 2015 conference and would like
to invite abstract submissions.
This symposium focuses on how dierent levels of se-
lection shape the link between genotype and phenotype
in microbial systems.
A number of recent discoveries have revolutionized our
understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern
the expression of microbial phenotypes as well as the se-
lective conditions that determine their evolution in the
long-run. For example, microbes combine stochastic
molecular processes with signals they receive from their
environment and from conspecics to produce pheno-
typic diversity in clonal populations, and to engage in
behaviours that have selective consequences for them-
selves as well as for the group. Moreover, by combin-
ing metabolic functions among microorganisms of the
same or dierent species, new group-level phenotypes
can emerge that drastically impact selection acting on
individual cells.
The aim of this symposium is to discuss how selectionat dierent levels of biological organization aects the
expression of phenotypes as well as to analyse how cell-
level phenotypes can promote functionality at the level
of groups. By drawing together empirical and theoret-
ical contributions from evolutionary and quantitative
biology, this interdisciplinary symposium will facilitate
discussions among scientists that otherwise would not
meet and help to identify future research avenues.

Lausanne ESEB SexChromosomes
Aug10-14
We would like to invite abstract submissions for a Sym-
posium on18 EvolDir December 1, 2014
The Evolution of Sex Chromosomes
to be held during the next ESEB Congress, Lausanne,
10-14 August 2015
The evolution of sex determination is a major ques-
tion in evolutionary biology. Until recently, however,
our views on sex determination and on the mechanisms
driving sex chromosome evolution have been heavily
based on data from only a handful of classically studied
model organisms (e.g. Mus, Drosophila, Caenorhab-
ditis, Silene), with a focus on the evolutionary conse-
quences of recombination arrest. With the recent ad-
vent of the genomic era, this eld is now experienc-
ing an empirical renaissance, expanding at an unprece-
dented pace. Next-generation tools have already led
to a urry of new discoveries. Attention has broad-
ened to non-model organisms, including algae and fungi
where sex is determined at the haploid level. Studies
on sh, amphibians and reptiles are imposing the view
that degeneration is not the ineluctable destiny of sex
chromosomes, and that the old dichotomy between ge-
netic and environmental sex determination should be
reappraised. Most importantly, the mechanisms of sex
determination appear now evolutionarily much more la-
bile than thought just one decade ago. What drives
the surprising dynamics of such a fundamental process
that, at the end, always leads to the same and simple
output, i.e. the production of males and females? With
this Symposium, we hope to gather theoreticians and
empiricists working on a diversity of systems, and in-
terested in the molecular mechanisms, ultimate causes,
and evolutionary consequences of sex chromosome evo-
lution.

SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION
Males and females share a genome but are often sub-
ject to divergent selection. This simple fact results in
tension between patterns of male and female adapta-
tion. The aim of this symposium is to highlight pheno-
types that experience intralocus sexual conict as well
as their genomic basis, in both laboratory and natural
systems. This includes conicts between the sexes in
reproductive strategies, ecological niches, rates of ag-
ing, and gene expression, for example. We will also
explore the larger signicance of sexually antagonistic
selection in the maintenance of genetic variation and
the evolution of sex chromosomes.
Submissions are invited for either talks (17 minutes in-
cluding discussion) or posters. The study of sexually
antagonistic tness eects is an active eld, with ma-
jor progress in the last few years, and we are especially
keen for contributions from early career researchers.

www3.unil.ch/wpmu/eseb2015/symposium list/
DESCRIPTION:
Understanding how speciation with gene ow works at
the genomic level is currently a major focus of speci-
ation biology. Genome scans between diverging pop-
ulations have become widespread, demonstrating that
the extent of dierentiation can be quite variable across
the genome. Highly dierentiated regions are often in-
terpreted as resulting from divergent selection, there-fore playing an important role in speciation. This view
is prominently expressed in the striking metaphor of
^ aspeciation islands'. Yet some debate remains. Is dier-
entiation generated by divergent natural selection act-
ing as a barrier to otherwise homogenising gene ow?
Or by recombination rate variation and/or intrinsic in-
compatibilities? Might dierentiation occur when gene
ow ceases and local adaptation increases the rate of
lineage sorting in some parts of the genome but not
others? And what genomic features aect homogenis-
ing gene ow? Being able to distinguish these alterna-
tive explanations is fundamental for understanding the
genomic basis of speciation with gene ow. This sympo-
sium will explore this debate, bringing together empiri-
cal evidence from dierent perspectives and focusing on
emerging approaches for identifying the processes that
cause the rugged landscape of genomic dierentiation.

Symposium Title : Variation in natural selection: pat-
terns, causes, and consequences
Despite longstanding interest in the dynamics of selec-
tion in space and time and its impact on adaptive evo-
lution, the topic has been remarkably resistant to gen-
eral empirical progress. This symposium will gather
contributions that address the following fundamental
questions using theoretical, empirical and experimental
approaches:
How much does natural/sexual selection vary in time
and space?
What is the evolutionary importance of uctuating se-
lection? In particular, can variation in selection explain
evolutionary stasis, that is, the absence of microevolu-
tion in traits that are heritable and appear under strong
directional selection?
What are causes (ecological drivers) of variation in se-
lection?
Under what conditions does spatial variation in se-
lection lead to local adaptation? These long-standing
questions may remain unresolved in part because of a
lack of a conceptual framework to guide empirical stud-
ies. Recent theoretical and synthetic studies have be-
gun to provide such a framework. We will bring to-
gether theoreticians and empiricists, and people who
have recently been developing methods specic to un-
derstanding variation in selection. The symposiumwith therefore be particularly timely in moving this
topic forward.

SYMPOSIUM DESCRIPTION: Proteins evolve by the
replacement of amino acids (substitutions) or the in-
sertion/deletion of fragments (indels). For the pro-
tein, mutations may be deleterious or benecial, gov-
erned by the laws of natural selection. Benecial mu-
tations increase the tness of the phenotype and are
more likely to become xed in the genome (positive
selection). Proteins are not robust to drastic changes
(i.e. important changes in stability) and mutations that
favour an adaptive functional change are generally ac-
companied by other coevolving mutations that insure
the integrity of the 3D structure (compensatory eect).
All these biophysical properties are paving the way for
protein evolution. Traditionally, there was little if any
crosstalk between the elds of protein biophysics, pro-
tein structure-function and molecular evolution. The
last several years have seen some exciting development
in merging these areas to obtain an in-depth under-
standing of how proteins evolve. For example, a betterDecember 1, 2014 EvolDir 21
understanding of how structural constraints aect pro-
tein evolution will greatly help to optimise stochastic
models of sequence evolution. The symposium aims at
exploring this new synthesis.
Abstracts will be selected for presentation by early
March. When submitting your abstract please state
your preference (talk, poster) during the submission
process. With questions please contact the symposium

for the \Real-time Bacterial Evolution in Vivo and in
Vitro" Symposium are now open. ESEB 2015 is taking
place in Lausanne, Switzerland, 10-14 August. Regis-
ter at the early bird rate now through the ESEB 2015
website (www.unil.ch/eseb2015). DEADLINE FOR
EARLY BIRD REGISTRATION IS MARCH 31st,

Real-time bacterial evolution in vivo and in vitro
Bacterial microevolution is important in determining
host-pathogen interactions, informing microbial foren-
sics, and characterizing the emerging threat of antibi-
otic resistance. Genomics is aording unprecedented
insights into these problems by casting light on the
adaptive and non-adaptive processes driving short-term
evolution of bacterial populations. The aim of this sym-
posium is to synthesize the recent profusion of exper-
imental and observational work in real-time bacterial
evolution, and to prompt a synergistic approach to un-
derstanding the selective forces driving bacterial evolu-
tion in the laboratory and within the host.

cuss open problems in the eld of mathematical and
computational evolutionary biology. The theme of this
year's edition will be new data, new questions, new
methods. New generation sequencing techniques have
multiplied not just the amount, but also the types of ge-
netic data produced, giving rise to new questions, and
new methodologies to answer them. These methodolo-
gies are often cross-disciplinary, with applications to di-
verse research topics. General concepts, models, meth-
ods and algorithms will also be presented and discussed,
just as during the previous conference editions.
WHERE and WHEN: Porquerolles Island, near Hy eres,
in the South of France, 21-25 June 2015.
Cost: Conference fees including accommodation for
four nights, meals, coee breaks, etc., will be between
300 euro and 630 euro , all inclusive, and will vary de-
pending on the room. PhD students and postdocs will
benet of the cheapest rooms.

11th ANNUAL EARLY CAREER SCIENTISTS SYM-
POSIUM
Ecosystems within organisms: Ecology and evolution
of the microbiome
The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biol-
ogy at the University of Michigan invites nominations
of outstanding scientists early in their careers to par-
ticipate in an exciting international symposium about
the ecological and evolutionary processes of the micro-
biome. The symposium events will take place from 27-
29 March 2015, in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
Seven early career scientists, alongside two keynote
speakers, will be selected to present their work and to
participate in panel discussions. We welcome nomina-
tions of early career scientists who are studying ecosys-
tems within organisms. Potential topics include the
role of the microbiome in disease processes, micro-
evolution, or development, meta-community theory in
host-associated communities, multi-host multi-parasite
systems, and eco-immunology. The research focus can
range from bacteria to metazoans and from tness ef-
fects on host organisms or their microbiota to the down-
stream eects of microbiomes on ecosystems. We are
interested in scientists with diverse expertise (including
anthropology, medicine, veterinary medicine, oceanog-
raphy, geobiology, virology, computer science, philoso-
phy of science).
Early career scientists are considered senior graduate
students (who stand to receive their Ph.D. within one

BostonU EvoDevo
The Warkentin Lab at Boston University seeks appli-
cations for a PhD student to work on our NSF-funded
project, 'The Development of Adaptive Embryo Behav-
ior.'
Project Overview
When to hatch is an essential decision embryos make,
based on environmental cues. Hatching is also a phys-
ical feat that embryos perform. The ability to assess
cues, exit the egg, and survive outside the egg all change
as embryos develop. Thus, under the same external
conditions, both what embryos can do and what they
should do to survive change developmentally. The over-
all project examines the development and regulation
of environmentally cued hatching in red-eyed treefrogs,
/Agalychnis callidryas/. These embryos hatch up to
40% prematurely to escape from threats to the egg,
using cues in at least two sensory modalities, and mul-
tiple selective trade-os shaping hatching timing are
known. The project integrates work on hatching mech-
anisms and performance, sensory system development,
and hatching decision rules for responses to simple hy-
poxia cues and complex mechanosensory cues, to ex-
amine why and how development changes behavior. It
will improve our understanding of embryo lives, behav-
ioral development, and how animals use dierent kinds
of information to make decisions.
Position Description
The student will participate in multiple aspects of the
project and be mentored to develop a dissertation that
builds on some component of the project and extends
to address independent questions. The student will be
based in the Ecology, Behavior, and Evolution group at
BU, conduct eld research at the Smithsonian Tropical
Research Institute in Gamboa, Panama and, depending
on specic interests, may be co-mentored by mechanical
engineer Greg McDaniel.

BremenU WaspMateChoice
PhD position: Genetic incompatibility and mate choice
in parasitoid wasps - A182/14 -
A PhD position is available for 3 years (payment 50%
TV-L E13) in the population ecology and evolution-
ary ecology group, headed by Prof. Dr. Thomas S.
Homeister, at the University of Bremen, Germany.
The University of Bremen comprises 19,000 students
and supports a broad range of academic disciplines.
The ambition and success of its research strategy is re-
ected in its being one of eleven universities, selected
within the German \Excellence Initiative".
Project outline: Allelic incompatibility between in-
dividuals of the same species should select for mate
choice based on the genetic make-up of both partners
at loci that inuence ospring tness. Therefore, mate
choice may be an important driver of allelic diversity.
A complementary sex determination (CSD) system is
responsible for intraspecic allelic incompatibility in
many species of ants, bees, and wasps. CSD may thus
favour disassortative mating and in this, resembles the
MHC of the vertebrate immune system, or the self-
incompatibility (SI) system of higher plants. The aim
of this project is to analyse mate choice behaviour in
the parasitic wasp Bracon brevicornis (Hymenoptera,
Braconidae), thereby disentangling the impact of indi-
rect (kin recognition) and direct (allele recognition) in-
uences of the genetic composition of mating partners.
The project will focus on proximate and ultimate cues
of mating preferences alike and consist of eldwork as
well as laboratory experiments and molecular work.
There is exibility in the programme and the precise di-
rection and emphasis of the project will be determined
by collaboration between the student and the supervi-
sors.
Applicants must have a master's degree, or equivalent,
in a relevant subject, e.g. ecology, animal behaviour,
entomology and/or evolutionary biology. We expect
an excellent knowledge of the English language in both
writing and speaking. The successful candidate will32 EvolDir December 1, 2014
receive high quality training in all relevant skills, con-
duct innovative research in a lively and active research
group, and participate in teaching activities at the BSc
or MSc level. The University of Bremen has received
a number of awards for its diversity policies and of-
fers a family friendly working environment. We strive
to increase the number of international researchers and
particularly solicit applications from suitably qualied
candidates. Applications from female candidates and
applications of academics with a migration background
are explicitly welcome. Disabled persons with the same
professional and personal qualications will be given
preference.
Applications should be sent include a scan of the Mas-
ter's diploma, a transcript of records, a CV, and a short
proposal explaining how the applicant would approach
the project, including specic hypotheses (maximum 1
page including references). Two potential researchers
should be mentioned in the cover letter who are willing
to supply letters of reference.
Applications should be sent by email in a single pdf
to Mrs. Inae Kim-Frommherz (inaekf@uni-bremen.de)
until 31.12.2014

CABI Switzerland InvasiveSpecies
Assessing non-target risks of candidates for the biolog-
ical control of Ambrosia artemisiifolia in Europe
The North American plant Ambrosia artemisiifolia,
common ragweed, has become one of the agship inva-
sive alien species in Europe, causing severe health issues
(allergies) and yield reductions in agriculture. While
herbicides and mechanical control are well suited as lo-
cal and short-term measures to control A. artemisiifolia,
sustainable control strategies to reduce its abundance
and spread as well as its pollen production in badly in-
fested areas are lacking in Europe. One of the main
objectives of the recently launched European COST
action SMARTER ('Sustainable management of Am-
brosia artemisiifolia in Europe'; ragweed.eu) is to de-
velop sustainable control strategies such as biological
control (BC), an approach which has been successfully
implemented against A. artemisiifolia in other conti-
nents.Within this project, an exciting PhD position funded
by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education and Re-
search (SER) is available at CABI in Switzerland
(cabi.org/about-cabi/cabi-centres/Switzerland), with
the coordinator of the Working Group 1 (Biological
Control) in SMARTER. The PhD aims to conduct
biosafety studies with exotic insect species that are
considered for BC of A. artemisiifolia in Europe. The
goal is to combine standard biosafety tests (assessment
of fundamental host-range) with new, innovative ap-
proaches that will strengthen the scientic quality of
non-target risk assessment, specically with regard to
i) host-range testing under open-eld conditions, and
ii) prediction of the population dynamics of BC can-
didates prior to their release into a new environment,
and iii) their impact on the population dynamics and
spread of common ragweed.
The student will be based at the CABI Centre in
Del emont, Switzerland, and registered at the Univer-
sity of Fribourg (www.unifr.ch). He/she will be closely
collaborating with the research group of Prof. Heinz
M uller-Sch arer (University of Fribourg; www.unifr.ch/-
ecology/groupmueller, Action chair of SMARTER) and
conduct eld work in North America and Israel.
Required competences:
* Master in natural science or related elds, preferably
with a background in insect-plant interactions or bio-
logical invasions
* Good skills in statistical analysis
* Experiences with population modelling are an asset
* High social competences in interacting with other re-
search colleagues and stakeholders
* Excellent skills in oral and written communications
(English)
* Highly dedicated and motivated student
What the research project oers:
* Work in a strong international and interdisciplinary
team
* PhD salary according to Swiss National Science Foun-
dation standards during 3 years
* Field expenses, travel allowances
* Close collaboration with research partners and stake-
holders of the European COST action SMARTER
(presently 180 participants from 33 countries, cf. rag-

overview.html Understanding how species adapt to the
environment they live in is a major goal in evolutionary
biology. This is of particular value in light of climate
change, where extant species will have to adapt to
warmer and potentially harsher conditions relatively
fast. However, identifying the genomic regions involved
in local adaptation has been a challenging problem
because the tools to survey species genomes have
only become available in the last two decades, e.g.
SNP arrays and whole genome sequencing. The aim
of this project is to analyse British sheep occurring
in contrasting environments (mountain vs. lowland)
using the Ovine HD SNP chip ( ~700,000 SNPs) to
identify genetic variation linked to local adaptation
in the UKs heterogeneous agricultural landscape.
Additionally, the SNP chip data will be analysed in
combination with whole genome data for a population
of Iranian wild mouon (the sheeps ancestor) and
Iranian sheep from the domestication centre in orderto identify genetic signatures of selection specic to
the domestication event.
The PhD student will be based 80% at Cardi Uni-
versity, where the research group specialises in identi-
fying signatures of selection using next generation se-
quencing in livestock and wildlife, and 20% at Bristol
University, a world leader in the development of sta-
tistical approaches to study demographic history using
genetic data. For this project the PhD student will
be trained in sample preparation for SNP chip analysis
and bioinformatics analyses (e.g. data quality lter-
ing, demographic analyses, and identifying signatures
of selection). This experimental design will allow the
PhD student to compare populations of British moun-
tain vs. lowland sheep, in the equivalent of a replicated
experiment, to identify specic signatures of local adap-
tation to the environment where these populations live
in, while controlling for confounding factors such as the
demographic history (to be simulated with approximate
Bayesian computation) and the selection signature left
by the domestication process (to be accounted for by
comparing domestic sheep against Iranian wild mou-
on).

CardiU NGS SlugsWeeds34 EvolDir December 1, 2014
BBSRC South West Doctoral Training Partnership,
UK Topic: Analysis of interactions between slugs and
weeds in arable crops using next generation sequencing
Main supervisor:Prof. William O.C. Symond-
son(School of Biosciences, Cardi University)
Second supervisor: Dr Ian P. Vaughan (School of Bio-
sciences, Cardi University)
Dr Pablo A. Orozco-terWengel (School of Biosciences,
Cardi University)
Dr James R Bell (North Wyke, Rothamsted Research)
Slugs are major crop pests throughout the temperate
world, especially in the UK where the climate fosters
high densities, threatening prots and food security.
They are ecosystem engineers, having hierarchies of
preference for the seedlings of dierent weed and crop
species that alter subsequent plant community com-
position. Removal of weeds (with herbicides) results
in greater slug damage to the crop while slug control
(with molluscicides) is highly weather-dependent and
slugs persist. Better understanding of the preferences
of slugs for dierent weed species oers the opportunity
to be more selective in the management of weeds and
slugs in major crops such as wheat and oilseed rape.
Selective herbicides can remove weed species less palat-
able to slugs, that are likely to be major competitors
(e.g. monocots like Blackgrass) with the crop, while
leaving seedlings that are palatable unharmed to po-
tentially divert slugs from consuming the crop.
Next Generation Sequencing will be used to analyse
plant DNA in gut and faecal samples collected from
slugs to determine their weed/crop preferences. We
will target the ITS2 gene, exploiting the near compre-
hensive database of Welsh and UK sequences that now
exists. Ratios of dierent plant species in the slugs will
be compared with the abundances of weeds and crop
plants in elds using Monte Carlo simulations and co-
occurrence modelling to determine preferences. Plots
trials will calibrate our eld results and test the viabil-
ity of selective weed control to protect crops.
The multidisciplinary team of supervisors will ensure
major training opportunities. WOCS will provide
training in molecular analysis of herbivory, using NGS;
POTW will provide bioinformatics training (NGS out-
put); IPV will supervise Monte Carlo model devel-
opment for herbivory and JRB will advise on co-
occurrence networks (for slug-weed interactions).
Rotations:1) NGS of gut contents requires comprehen-
sive barcode databases for sequence identication. The
student will be provided with a self-contained set of
material to barcode from ongoing work into the diets ofendangered species (supervisor WOCS). Expertise will
be acquired in both practical molecular analyses and
tree construction. 2) A major problem in diet analy-
ses is dierential DNA survival during digestion of se-
quences from dierent species, compounded by factors
such as amplicon size and gene copy number. Feeding
trials (using project-relevant slugs and weeds) will be
conducted and decay curves will be incorporated into
new Monte Carlo plant choice models (supervisor IPV).
Training will be in conducting trials and model devel-
opment, both directly relevant to the PhD.For informa-

( http://biology.case.edu/faculty/ryan-martin/) in the
Department of Biology at Case Western Reserve Uni-
versity. Research in the lab is broadly focused on un-
derstanding how biotic interactions and environmental
variation drive adaptive evolution and diversication.
Specic research topics of the lab include the evolution
of resource polymorphism; causes and consequences of
disruptive selection; the evolution of character displace-
ment; and signal evolution in heterogeneous environ-
ments. We primarily investigate these topics in desert
amphibians, and freshwater shes.
The students and faculty of the Department of Biology
at Case Western Reserve comprise a collegial, interac-
tive and dynamic group. Faculty research programs
in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology span interests in
amphibian ecology, evolution and conservation (Mike
Benard), theoretical ecology (Karen Abbott and Robin
Snyder), plant community ecology and phylogenetics
(Jean Burns), and ecological and evolutionary conse-
quences of global change (Sarah Diamond).
Case Western Reserve University is an excellent place
for graduate research. In addition to CWRU, there are
several nearby institutions with top-tier lab facilities
and ecologically diverse eld sites, including the Uni-
versity Farm, Holden Arboretum, and the ClevelandDecember 1, 2014 EvolDir 35

The Gibbons lab (https://wordpress.clarku.edu/-
jgibbons/) in the Department of Biology at Clark
University is accepting applications for PhD students
to start in August 2015.
The overarching research theme of our lab is to under-
stand how evolutionary forces shape the genome and
how these changes inuence phenotype. More speci-
cally, our lab studies (i) how selection alters the struc-
ture and function of fungal genomes and, (ii) how copy
number variation inuences genome architecture, and
gene expression. To gain a comprehensive understand-
ing of these topics, we heavily utilize whole genome
Next Generation Sequencing data to characterize pat-
terns of genomic variation. Additionally, we pair these
computational analyses with functional experiments
spanning the realms of transcriptomics, proteomics,
and metabolomics. Applicants interested in fungal biol-
ogy will also have opportunities to interact and collab-
orate with the Hibbett lab (http://www.clarku.edu/-

PhD opportunities in the Molecular Ecology Group
in Durham, UK (see https://www.dur.ac.uk/-
biosciences/ for information about the department and
University)
Projects:
1) Evolution of habitat specialisation in the Arctic char
The evolution of multiple divergent phenotypes in post-
glacial lakes has occurred repeatedly and independently
in many sh taxa including salmonids (e.g. Salmo,
Oncorhynchus, & Salvelinus species), the three-spined
stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), and smelt (Os-
merus species). In this study next generation sequenc-
ing methodologies will be applied to understandingthe evolution of char (Salvelinus alpinus) ecotypes in
British lakes, comparing multiple sympatric morphs in
separate lake systems.
2) The relative contribution of genetic drift and natural
selection on founder populations of deer
Population bottlenecks and founder events are an
important part of evolutionary process, generating
stochastic variation among populations and potentially
changing evolutionary trajectories. Natural selection
is a weak force compared to genetic drift when pop-
ulation size is very small, yet strong selection could
overcome this. In this study founder populations of
reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) on South Georgia and roe
deer (Capreolus capreolus) in the UK will be investi-
gated using next generation sequencing methodologies
to better understand the relative importance of drift
and selection following founder events.
3) Role of habitat boundaries in the evolution of popu-
lation genetic structure in marine systems
A long-standing objective in evolutionary biology is un-
derstanding the mechanisms and drivers that determine
the patterns and rate of dierentiation, and eventual
speciation among populations. Connectivity (the real-
ized potential for gene ow among populations) is key,
but there are various interacting factors that determine
the spatial and temporal pattern of movement. In this
study the student will take advantage of a well-studied
system where there is suspected to be an important
interaction between prey choice and gene ow for the
bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). While based
in Durham, this project will be co-supervised by Oscar
Gaggiotti in St. Andrews and Per Berggren in Newcas-
tle.

GhentU AvianBiodiversity
The Department of Biology at Ghent University is seek-
ing to ll a full-time PhD position vacancy (m/f) on
Avian Foodweb Ecology in Fragmented Landscapes
Background
While habitat fragmentation is increasingly recognized
as one of the prime drivers underlying the current global
biodiversity crisis, changes in foodweb dynamics result-
ing from habitat fragmentation have so far received
scant attention in functional biodiversity studies. By
applying state-of-the-art tools from ecological, forestry
and epidemiological research disciplines within a unique
plot design, biologists, bio-engineers and wildlife vets of
Ghent University aim to ll this gap by scaling up func-
tional biodiversity research from a classical plot to a
landscape level, and from producer dynamics to preda-
tor tness. The research consortium that conducts this
ambitious, 6 year research program will host 6 PhD stu-
dents, each focusing on particular components of the
terrestrial food web.Project
This PhD project focuses on how tree diversity and the
spatial conguration of broad-leaved forest fragments
aect the ecology, health and performance of a sec-
ondary avian predator (great tit, Parus major), and
how this shapes its predatory impact on arthropod pop-
ulations (herbivore control). Higher nutritional quality
in more diverse forests is thereby predicted to improve
health by facilitating a better development of avian im-
munity and thereby reducing disease susceptibility. A
highly fragmented habitat, in turn, is predicted to re-
duce health through an increase in the use of anthro-
pogenic (lower quality) food and pathogen exposure at
forest boundaries, owing to increased contact with hu-
man habitation. The successful applicant will imple-
ment a variety of eld-, aviary- and lab-tools, and will
work closely together with other PhD students, eld
assistants and postdocs.
Prole
You hold a Master degree in Biology or an equivalent
Life Sciences degree, with a strong background in pop-
ulation and community ecology.
You are an enthusiastic and motivated student who can
deal with long hours in the eld, aviary and lab.
You have excellent organizational, writing and presen-
tation skills and are capable of working both indepen-
dently and within a multidisciplinary team.
Prior experience with ornithology and/or foodweb ecol-
ogy is highly recommended but not restrictive.
Oer
A Ph.D. scholarship for one year (starting between 1
Jan and 1 Feb 2015) with a three-year extension after
positive evaluation.
Enrolment in the Ghent Doctoral School training pro-
gram that oers various courses, training programs and

Research Summary:
Most animals are able to repair wounds and many can
regenerate extensively, re-growing organs or even entire
body plans from small fragments. Very little is known
about how wounding results in repair and/or regener-
ation, or whether these mechanisms are similar across
diverse animal species. The lab will take an integrative
approach for studying wound response and stem cell
biology during regeneration in an evolutionary frame-
work by using a broad range of techniques including
transcriptional proling and lineage tracing.
A major focus of the lab will be the three-banded pan-
ther worm, Hofstenia miamia, an acoel species that is
a new model system for studies of regeneration and de-
velopment. Acoels are likely to be the earliest lineage
of animals with bilateral symmetry (bilaterians), and
are therefore in a phylogenetically informative position
for understanding the evolution of regenerative mech-
anisms. Hofstenia has many advantages as a model
regenerative species, for example: RNAi that can be
administered by soaking; tools for studying gene func-
tion; and the ability to isolate stem cells. Hofstenia
also produces accessible embryos that enable compar-
isons of regeneration and development, and provide a
unique opportunity to use gene-delivery and genome-
editing tools to study regeneration.
Various projects are available for studying genetic and
cellular mechanisms underlying the wound response
and regulation of stem cells in Hofstenia as well as for
comparing regeneration between dierent regenerative
animal species including cnidarians and planarians. InDecember 1, 2014 EvolDir 41
addition to uncovering new mechanisms, these studies
will aim to learn which aspects of animal regeneration
are conserved, and which evolved independently along
dierent animal lineages.

ing in social insect biology, jointly supervised by me

pgstudy/phd opportunities/gene expression Project
outline: This project will attempt to establish the
role of genomic imprinting in the important pollinator
species, the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. Genomic im-
printing is the dierential expression of alleles in diploid
individuals, with the expression being dependent upon
the sex of the parent from which it was inherited. Ge-
nomic imprinting is an important area of research in
plant breeding and in evolutionary biology and has rel-
evance to some human cancers and developmental syn-
dromes. Bees are potentially a model for genomic im-
printing because theyhave a small, sparsely methylated
genome.
The PhD student will carry out all experiments and
bioinformatic analysis under the guidance of the super-
visory team. They will be provided with training in

MaxPlanck GenomicsOfMigration
Opening for a PhD student Genomics of Migration
My group combines several biological disciplines includ-
ing behavioural observation, evolutionary genomics,
molecular ecology, and bioinformatics, and utilises
emergent technologies to identify the genetic basis of
migratory traits.
Here we focus on identifying the genes and signalling
pathways behind the components shaping the migra-
tory phenotype in the blackcap, a well characterized
migratory songbird species. We will complement the se-
quencing approach with gene expression proling and
characterisation of chromatin modication to investi-
gate the extent of phenotypic variation manifested by
expression dierences, either through slight genetic dif-
ferences or epigenetic processes.
Within this project that is funded through a Max
Planck Research Group Grant, I am oering a PhD
position. Project start is January 2015 and the ideal
starting date for the PhD is April 2015.
The ideal candidate for this position has a biologi-
cal training, a background in using next-generation se-
quencing data to answer evolutionary questions, and is
eager to learn and master new skills and tools to under-
stand the genetic architecture of behavioural traits. Ex-December 1, 2014 EvolDir 43
perience in genome assembly or annotation, and skills
in programming are a bonus. The core project focuses
on various levels of genomic analysis, but the focus of
the PhD project is exible and can be tailored to both
skills and interest of the successful candidate, and could
cover genome assembly and annotation, or comparison
of the genomic makeup and underlying signaling path-
ways of dierent populations with various migratory
phenotypes, and may also involve behavioural experi-
ments and eld work.
PhD candidates at the institute have the opportunity
to become member of the International Max Planck
Research School (IMPRS) for Evolutionary Biology
in collaboration with the nearby Christian Albrechts
University of Kiel (for more information see: http://-
www.evolbio.mpg.de/14849/aboutIMPRS)
We oer an English speaking and ambitious working en-
vironment at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary
Biology in Pl on, Germany. Cutting edge infrastructure
is available at all levels, including high-performance
computer clusters and next-generation sequencing core
facility. The Institutes main elds of work include evo-
lutionary ecology (Prof. Dr. M. Milinski), evolutionary
genetics (Prof. Dr. D. Tautz) and evolutionary theory
(Prof. Dr. A. Traulsen) and hosts a number of research
groups providing ample opportunities for collaborations
and interactions.
The Max Planck Society is committed to also employ-
ing handicapped individuals and especially encourages
them to apply. The Max Planck Society seeks to in-
crease the number of women in those areas where they
are underrepresented and therefore explicitly encour-

/Background/
The group works on adaptation of parasites to their
host and host driven speciation using dierent plant
pathogenic fungi. A main goal of our research is
to understand the underlying molecular mechanism
of species divergence and adaptive processes in host-
pathogen systems. To this end, we combine molecular
biology, microscopic and bioinformatic approaches. A
recent topic in the group is the importance of histone
modications in host-pathogen interactions as well as
genome dynamics.

changing stochastic environmental conditions, is cur-
rently an active area of biological research. Recent the-
oretical developments provide predictions for the rela-

phenotypic plasticity in temporally autocorrelated en-
vironment. Whereas phenotypic plasticity alone makes
the phenotypic mean of a population dependent on the
environment at time of development only, phenotypic
uctuations resulting from genetic evolution can be
seen as an exponential moving average process, smooth-
ing out underlying environmental uctuations. This
make the main aim of the present PhD-project, estimat-

motivated Ph.D. students to start in Fall 2015.
Our lab uses computational approaches to study the
origin of genotypic and phenotypic innovation. We are
broadly interested in a number of problems in evolu-
tionary genomics. One current focus of our research
is on gene duplication, which is a major contributor of
new gene functions. Potential projects related to gene
duplication include examining the role of natural se-
lection in the origin of new functions, elucidating the
genic and functional targets of natural selection, com-
paring functions that arise under dierent evolutionary
scenarios, and applying mathematical models to study
gene expression evolution. There are also opportuni-
ties to study the origin and evolution of small RNAs,
enhancers, and other noncoding functional elements in
the genome.
The above lists only serve as examples, and candidates
interested in alternative research projects in evolution-
ary genomics are encouraged to apply. Also, note that
our lab is solely computational. While prior knowledge
of a programming language is not necessary, candidates
should have strong quantitative skills and the drive to
learn how to program.
If you are interested in joining the lab, please email
Raquel Assis ( rassis@psu.edu) a current CV and de-

PlantEcologyEvolutionaryBiology
I am currently recruiting motivated graduate students
to join my lab in the Biology Department at Temple
University. Our research addresses a broad range of
questions in plant reproductive ecology and evolution,
exploring how ecological, demographic, and genetic fac-
tors inuence plant mating patterns and shape the evo-
lution of reproductive traits. Current foci in the lab
are (1) the eects of habitat fragmentation on plant-
pollinator interactions, mating system dynamics, and
oral trait evolution and (2) the evolution of mixed-
mating and of the selng syndrome. Additional inter-
ests include the evolution of plant sexual systems such
as dioecy. We use a variety of approaches including ob-
servational and experimental eld studies, population
and quantitative genetics, demographic modeling, and
greenhouse studies.
I am looking for a PhD student to join the lab who
is broadly interested in plant ecology and evolution
and looking to develop independent research questions
that complement my own. If interested, please send a
cover letter describing your research interests and back-
ground, a CV including GPA, GRE scores (if known),
and contact information for three references to RachelSpigler at rachel.spigler@temple.edu. Applicants must
have a Bachelor's degree in ecology or a related eld,
prior research experience, and meet Temple's require-
ments for admission. A Master's degree is preferred.
Interested applicants should contact me as soon as pos-
sible; Temple's deadline for admission is January 15,
2015.

Title: PhD-ship at the University of Aberdeen (UK),
on Niche Evolution in a Warming World
**This PhD project is being advertised as part of a

Description: Many organisms are currently respond-
ing to climate change with dramatic shifts in their ge-
ographic ranges and ecological niches. However, the
mechanisms underlying these biotic consequences of
rapidly changing climates remain poorly understood.
It is critical to improve our understanding in this area
of research, as many pests and disease-carrying species
are currently expanding under global climate change,
while other, less rapidly evolving species face extinc-
tion. In this PhD project, the student will investigate
a number of hypothetical evolutionary trajectories that
could underlie or constrain rapid niche shifts occurring
during climate-induced range expansions. This repre-
sents an exciting opportunity to contribute to scien-
tic understanding of evolution under environmental
change and to develop knowledge to inform conserva-
tion and management. Specically, the project will in-
vestigate how shifts in a species' resource use traits,
climate tolerances, and dispersal abilities contribute to
niche evolution, and will seek to characterise evolution-
ary trade-os among these traits that my constrain a
species' ability to adapt to a rapidly-changing world.
There will be ample opportunity for the student to pro-
pose and test their own hypotheses for niche evolution
mechanisms, incorporating additional processes and ef-
fects such as mating system evolution, indirect genetic
eects, epigenetics, etc., following the research interests
of the student. ^ a^ aThe PhD project oers opportunity
to learn a variety of important methods in evolutionary
biology, including experimental evolution/quantitative
genetics in lab-based organisms (using seed beetles, a
currently evolving global crop pest), individual-based
modelling approaches, and oers opportunities for eld
ecology approaches in northeast Scotland, to allow the
student to become familiar with evolutionary and eco-
logical dynamics in wild, evolving insect systems.
Funding Notes: This project is eligible for the
EASTBIO Doctoral Training Partnership: http://-
www.eastscotbiodtp.ac.uk/ .This opportunity is only
open to UK nationals (or EU students who have been
resident in the UK for at least three years immediately
prior to the programme start date) due to restrictions
imposed by the funding body.

We seek a highly-motivated student for a fully-funded
PhD scholarship position commencing in 2015. The
project will investigate environmental stress induction
of epigenetic variation in colonial tunicates. More
broadly, the project seeks to determine if epigenetic
changes provide an evolutionary 'buer' against rapid
environmental change and a mechanism to compensate
for low levels of conventional genetic variation.
The student will be enrolled at the University of
Auckland (www.auckland.ac.nz) but will be based
at the Cawthron Institute, Nelson, New Zealand
(www.cawthron.org.nz). The successful applicant will
have a sound background in both molecular and popula-
tion genetics along with a good grasp of bioinformatics
theory. The student must be comfortable with learning
new software for bioinformatic and statistical analyses.
An ecological background would also be advantageous.
Applicants should hold a relevant Hons / Master's de-
gree and must be eligible to enrol in the University
of Auckland's PhD programme. This PhD scholarship
has an annual stipend of NZ$25,000 (tax free) plus stu-
dent fees for a period of 3 years subject to satisfactory
progress. International (i.e. non-New Zealand resident)
students are welcome and encouraged to apply.

The Institute of Ecology & Evolution at the University
of Bern oers excellent opportunities and infrastructure
for theoretical and experimental research in the eld of
ecology and evolution. It hosts six chairs, several as-
sociated professors and junior group leaders with com-
plementary, yet overlapping and linked areas of schol-
arship. It is home to a large number of post-doctoral
researchers, PhD and MSc students from dierent coun-
tries worldwide.
Research at the chair of Behavioural Ecology focuses
on the evolution of sociality and cooperation, within-
population individual variation of behaviour and life
history pathways, and the inuence of early experience
on life-long and transgenerational traits and decisions.
In addition to theoretical modelling, our research uses
cichlid shes from Lake Tanganyika, ambrosia beetles
and Norway rats as model systems. We combine so-
phisticated behavioural experiments in the laboratory
and eld with long-term monitoring of individual life
histories in nature, develop theoretical models of evo-
lutionary mechanisms underlying behaviour, and study
molecular mechanisms by transcriptome proling and
hormone manipulations. Currently the division com-
prises roughly 30 sta and student members.

1st project: Integration of early environmental infor-
mation within and across generations in a cooperative
breeder
Early life conditions can have life-long eects on the
phenotypic development of animals. Most research in
developmental plasticity focuses only on a single envi-
ronmental trigger or ontogenetic stage. However, natu-
ral environments are usually complex. If we aim to un-
derstand the development of well-integrated adult phe-
notypes, we must consider eects of multiple ecological
factors during multiple ontogenetic stages. The highly
social cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher is a unique model
system to study the development of integrated pheno-
types, because it uses environmental cues to specialize
on one of two life history strategies during ontogeny,52 EvolDir December 1, 2014
namely early own reproduction or delayed dispersal to
help rearing ospring of dominant breeders. N. pulcher
is a well-studied model system of social evolution that
is exceptionally suited to experiments in the eld and
laboratory. Within this project, two PhD positions are
currently available:
Position 1: \Environmental inuences on development
during dierent ontogenetic stages" The aim of this
PhD-project is to investigate the relative signicance of
four important environmental inuences for the devel-
opment of helping and dispersal propensities of N. pul-
cher: prenatal maternal eects, brood care, early juve-
nile and late juvenile environments. Position 2: \Long-
term eects of early environment within and across gen-
erations" This PhD project investigates whether the
early environment inuences adult life histories and re-
productive performance, and whether it aects the phe-
notypes of successive generations through epigenetic
inheritance. Both PhD projects will pursue a mul-
tidisciplinary approach involving behavioural experi-
ments in the laboratory, eld work, ecological genomics
and/or quantitative meta-analysis. Eligible candidates
will have a master$B!G(Bs degree (or equivalent) in Bi-
ology and research experience in animal behaviour and
a genuine understanding of evolutionary theory. Prac-
tical skills in molecular genetics techniques, the appli-
cation of statistical models and empirical work with
sh would be benecial, but they are not a precondi-
tion. The project will be mostly based in Bern, but will
involve collaboration with Nadia Aubin-Horth (Univer-
sity Laval, Canada) for the molecular analyses and with
Shinishi Nakagawa (University of Otago, New Zealand)
for meta-analysis. Supervisor: Barbara Taborsky.
2nd project: The use of information in social decisions
Position 3: $B!H(BConditional decisions to stay or dis-
perse in fungus tending ambrosia beetles$B!I(B When
deciding to stay or disperse from the natal territory,
information about the quality of potential dispersal ar-
eas may be limited and costly to obtain. Modelling
results imply that the stage before dispersal decisions
are made is of particular interest to understand social
evolution. Ambrosia beetles are cooperative breeders
cultivating fungi for food. Individual dispersal is timed
in dependence of the need for cooperative care in the
natal colony. Here we ask whether and how disper-
sal decisions depend on (i) the body condition of bee-
tles, (ii) the microbial condition in the natal gallery,
and (iii) the sustainability of the substrate in which
they live. Experiments will show how beetles respond
to the microbial composition of their gallery, including

their timing of dispersal. The utility of galleries will be

*A system biology approach to study mechanisms of
response to anthropogenic stress in aquatic ecosystems
using Daphnia as emerging model system*
The decline of water quality due to anthropogenic
changes (e.g. climate change, land use, sewage inow,
chemical pollution) is a recognized threat to ecosystem
services and to the economy. However, the causes and
eects of such changes occur over many decades, and
are therefore dicult to measure and hence dicult
to regulate. The growing application of genomics to
species with well-studied ecologies has helped to iden-
tify mechanisms of adaptation, including variation in
gene regulatory regions, genic polymorphism and copy
number variation [1 <#ENREF 1>]. */However,/*
*/we have yet to understand the mechanisms of adap-
tation of natural species to anthropogenic stress. This
limits our ability to assess the resilience of natural sys-
tems to human-driven changes, with severe implication
for ecosystem services and the economy/. *Accurate
measurements of the eects of human driven changes
on natural populations and communities is critical for
gauging the eects of ecological drift, anthropogenic or
otherwise, on biodiversity. To date, such changes have
been poorly documented, owing, in part, to the paucity
of datasets spanning long periods of time (e.g. several
decades or centuries). To design a study across the
time-span of multiple human careers, */we propose a
revolutionary approach that dramatically advances the
state-of-the-art to generate longitudinal data within the
scope of a single research project/*. Propagules from

banks can be sampled (cored) preserving their tempo-
ral arrangements and accurately dated, thereby align-
ing their local population and community histories to
known changes in the environment, or to environmen-
tal changes inferred from analyses of the sediments
or soils. Species of the genus /Daphnia/ are by far
the best studied metazoans in the practise of \resur-

These studentships will be competitively awarded, and
fully funded, and are open to all EU applicants. How-
ever, funding for living costs as well as tuition fees is
only available for UK students.
The deadline for applications is 15th January 2015.

(1) Evolutionary rescue in the face of climate change?
Testing for local adaptation at the southern range mar-
gins of European butteries
We are looking for a highly-motivated student to test
the ecological eects of climate change on buttery
communities, and the role of evolution in increasing
their resilience. Profound eects on ecosystem function
are predicted as climate change generates rapid shifts54 EvolDir December 1, 2014
in species geographical distributions. Many organisms
have already contracted their ranges at equatorial mar-
gins to higher altitudes, and expanded their ranges as
their poleward margins become increasingly habitable.
However, these responses seem limited by rates of evo-
lution. Although most generalist species have shifted
their ranges, most specialist species remain trapped in
increasingly fragmented habitats, apparently because
they cannot adapt to local conditions at their ecolog-
ical margins. Dening critical levels of environmental
change therefore depends on understanding how eas-
ily (and how quickly) evolutionary rescue can occur at
ecological margins.
This project will explore evolution in European but-
teries at their southern (contacting) margins in com-
parison to that observed at their northern (expanding)
margins. Adaptive divergence may be easier at con-
tracting margins because population sizes are initially
high, making genetic variation locally available. By
contrast, at expanding margins evolution may require
the spread of novel mutations from distant populations,
or may cause the rapid loss of adaptive variation.
You will: (i) conduct buttery and host plant surveys
in central Spain, and comparing their thermal niches
to our previous data; (ii) Use population genomics to
test for local adaptation at contracting range margins in
comparison to those involved in poleward expansions;
(iii) conduct eld transplant experiments to test for
adaptive divergence in maternal behaviour and larval
survival and and by testing larval growth rate at dier-
ent altitudes.
You will be based at the University of Bristol, with pe-
riods at the University of Exeter, and two eld seasons
in Madrid. You will receive expert training in popu-
lation ecology and genomics, spatial ecology, and the
application of evolutionary theory to conservation pol-
icy.
(2) The role of habitat heterogeneity in climate-
proong conservation: integrating eects of microcli-
mate on population dynamics and local adaptation
There is an urgent need to understand and predict
where species will persist under climate change. Con-
ventional bioclimate models neglect the capacity of lo-
cal variation in habitat (topography and vegetation
structure) to drive the regional dynamics and distri-
butions of species through their eects on local adapta-
tion and population dynamics. This project will com-
bine empirical databases and modelling with eld and
experimental work to test the importance of habitat
heterogeneity for the conservation of an exemplar sys-
tem, buttery species breeding in fragmented habitats
in Britain.You will: (i) Use remotely-sensed and ground-truthed
vegetation information combined with ne-resolution
microclimate models to develop composite maps of
habitat and microclimate for the Brown Argus and
Silver-studded blue butteries in South-West England;
(ii) Analyse existing population monitoring databases
to test eects of modelled spatial and temporal varia-
tion in habitat and microclimate on the population dy-
namics of these species for the past three decades; (iii)
Carry out eld sampling of egg-laying sites to detect
the eects of habitat heterogeneity on local ecological
specialisation, and genome scans

GRADUATE POSITIONS AT UC BERKELEY
A PhD position is available at UC Berkeley as part of
a project that seeks to merge two disparate areas of
research to understand patterns of biodiversity, (1) a
broad ecological approach which provides insights into
how species assemble and interact in a community;
(2) a lineage based approach which focuses on how
arthropod species adapt, diversity, or decline over
time. We integrate these two approaches by using a
system of age-structured biological communities on
the youngest of the Hawaiian Islands (Hawaii), and
comparing these to communities on the next older
island of Maui. Within Hawaii Island, lineages of or-
ganisms are actively diversifying, while the community
and food web contexts in which they are embedded
are changing with the development of their habitats.
The system is relatively simple ecologically, but impor-
tantly it represents an environmental chronosequence,
allowing for a \space-for-time" substitution. The
project (part of NSF's \Dimensions in Biodiversity"
http://www.nsf.gov/news/news summ.jsp?cntn id=-
125495&org=BIO&from=news ) will look at priority,
sequence, and associated interaction strengths among
members of a community as it develops, and hence
how biodiversity is generated, assembled, and lost.
Students interested in any one of the following are en-
couraged to apply: (1) macroecological metrics of di-December 1, 2014 EvolDir 55
versity and abundance of species and how these might
change over time; (2) dynamics of predator-prey or
other interactions between species; (3) evolutionary
adaptation and speciation. Data to be analyzed will in-
clude molecular, morphological, ecological, and/or be-
havioral characters, and will involve macroecological,
macroevolutionary, and population genetic and phylo-
genetic analyses. A single student will focus on one
aspect of the project, though interest in the integra-
tion between ecological and evolutionary approaches is
encouraged.
Project PIs and contributors at UC Berkeley are: Rose-
mary Gillespie, Patrick O'Grady, George Roderick &
Kari Goodman in the Department of Environmental
Science, Policy, and Management (ESPM); John Harte,

HostPathogenInteractions
Two PhD scholarships in host-pathogen interactions
and insect immunocompetence
Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences,
Faculty of Science at the University of Copenhagen
(UCPH) is oering two PhD scholarships in host-
pathogen interactions, one commencing on the 1st of
April, and the other on the 1st of May 2015. The appli-
cation deadline for both positions is the 1st of January
2015.Project description
Organisms in most ecosystems are exposed to para-
sites and pathogens, increasingly in combination with
chronic exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of pesti-
cides. Recent studies indicate that combined exposure
to pathogenic and chemical stress may lead to more
profound disease manifestation. An interdisciplinary
research project at UCPH headed by Associate Profes-
sor Brian Lund Fredensborg is developing a conceptual
insect-pathogen model to explore the impact of chemi-
cal stress on host and pathogen parameters.
The successful applicants will join a dynamic team
working on unraveling the mechanisms behind the com-
bined eects of low doses of pesticides (pyrethroids and
azoles) and two dierent pathogens, a fungus and a
tapeworm, on the beetle Tenebrio molitor. The project
provides an excellent opportunity to gain a broad set
of state-of-the-art laboratory skills, and for interdisci-
plinary collaborations.
PhD student 1: Host-Pathogen interactions
Starting date: 1st of April 2015
The main task is to experimentally quantify host
and pathogen tness parameters in relation to chem-
ical stress from pesticides. The successful applicant
preferably has a background in host-parasite or host-
pathogen interactions using an experimental and eco-
logical approach.
Information on applying for this position may be found
on: http://employment.ku.dk/phd/?show=700643
PhD student 2: Insect immunocompetence
Starting date: 1st of May 2015
The main task is to identify and quantify host immune
response parameters to pathogen infection in relation
to chemical stress from pesticides. The successful ap-
plicant preferably has a background in host-pathogen
interactions. Knowledge on the use of immunological
and molecular methods is advantageous. Experience
with invertebrate immune response to infection using
an experimental approach is particularly relevant.

EvolutionOfFungalTrophicFunctions
Funded PhD Positions in Fungal Evolutionary Biol-
ogy Supervised by Tom Richards & Ken Haynes Bio-
sciences, University of Exeter, UK
Fungi make a living by secreting enzymes to breakdown
complex material in the extra-cellular environment cou-
pled with production of transporter proteins to import
processed nutrients. These functions allow fungi to col-
onize dierent environments including plant and ani-
mal hosts and engage in resource competition through
public goods games. The aim of this PhD project is
to reconstruct the evolution of ecology dening trans-
porter genes in yeast fungi, allowing comparison of how
gene/genome changes have underpinned diversication
in these microbes. The work will then use phenotype
assays of extant and ancestral protein forms to investi-
gate the evolution of transporter functions. This work
will provide the basic science for understanding how dif-
ferent fungi, including important pathogens, make use
of dierent environmental resources.

UGuelph AdaptiveDiversication
Graduate Opportunity - Adaptive Diversication in the
Wild
What causes a population to diversify? How are the
axes of diversication limited? What are the genetic
bases of adaptive diversication in natural populations?58 EvolDir December 1, 2014
These questions are central to understanding the diver-
sity of life and yet remain as key challenges in evolution-
ary biology. As part of an international collaboration,
we attempt to answer such questions. There is an ex-
citing opportunity for a promising graduate student to
join us, at PhD or MSc level, in exploring the processes
underlying adaptive diversication in nature.
Project overview: Adaptive diversication describes a
process where a single population can split into two
stable populations due to competitive interactions and
despite gene ow. Our multifaceted approach to un-
derstanding these early stages of divergence involves
disentangling the ecological and genetic mechanisms
relevant in natural systems. We study the evolution
of ecologically-specialised morphs of Icelandic Arctic
charr (Salvelinus alpinus), where remarkable intralacus-
trine diversication repeatedly occurs along a benthic-
limnetic continuum. This system allows us to investi-
gate the roles of selection and genetic architecture in
diversication under natural conditions.
Position description: We are seeking a motivated and
talented graduate student with an interest in under-
standing the genetic basis of diversication. The posi-
tion will involve a combination of eldwork with expo-
sure to state-of-the-art molecular techniques, with time
spent both in Iceland and in Canada. Funding opportu-
nities are available for Canadian or Icelandic students;
students of other nationalities will be considered depen-
dent on other sources of funding (e.g. Ontario Trillium
Scholarship).

statement of research interests and curriculum vitae to
Dr. Moira Ferguson at mmfergus@uoguelph.ca.

ULeicester TyrosineKinaseEvolution
Dear evoldir
A PhD studentship is available by competition to study
the molecular evolution of tyrosine kinases, jointly62 EvolDir December 1, 2014
supervised by me (Dr Ed Hollox) and Prof Nick
Brindle at the University of Leicester. Further details
at http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross fac/mibtp/-
pgstudy/phd opportunities/gene expression Project
outline: Although multicellularity has evolved several
times in eukaryotes, its evolution in metazoa is of par-
ticular interest, because of the range of distinct cell
types observed in metazoans leading to highly complex
and mobile organisms. Tyrosine kinases (Y kinases) are
an important family of proteins involved in mediating
cell-cell signalling. They evolved from serine-threonine
kinases (ST kinases) around 600 million years ago and
are found only in metazoans and choanoagellates. Y
kinases are thought to be critical in enabling the evolu-
tion of multicellularity in metazoans by developing an
extra signalling space for cell-cell communication (1).
It is not known how the tyrosine kinase signalling sys-
tem evolved, and what biochemical constraints on the
protein sequence space there were in the evolution of
tyrosine kinases.
This multidisciplinary project combines bioinformatics,
evolutionary genetic analysis, experimental evolution
and biochemistry to determine how Y kinases evolved.
The initial step, supervised by Ed Hollox, will infer
ancestral pre-Y kinase and proto-Y kinase domain se-
quences from Kinbase, a highly curated database. The
second step will be investigation of the biochemistry of
the transition between pre-Y and proto-Y kinase do-
main using an in-vitro evolution system in the lab of
Nick Brindle.

able as part of the Midlands Integrative Biosciences

FungalMetaboliteEvolution
Seeking outstanding students interested in evolution-

fall 2015.
Fungal secondary metabolites are enigmatic small
molecules that shape the interaction of fungi with
plants and other organisms. Using a combination of
next generation sequencing, natural products chem-
istry, molecular genetics, and metabolomics, we ex-
amine the evolution, diversity, and functions of these
metabolites, with a focus on large modular proteins
such as nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs)
and polyketide synthetases (PKSs). Current research
is focused on population genomic analyses and ne-
scale evolution of NRPS secondary metabolites among
strains of Tolypocladium inatum, a fungal pathogen
of beetles. Questions addressed include looking at
how selection on secondary metabolite genes, together
with horizontal transfer and transposition in fungal
genomes shapes the evolution of new chemical com-
pounds. Other projects in the lab include identication
of regulatory networks involved in controlling secondary
metabolism, characterizing genome features that allow
fungi to interact with distinct hosts (insects, plants,
and other fungi), and examining the roles of endophytic
fungi and their metabolites in mediating plant resis-
tance to insect and nematode pests.64 EvolDir December 1, 2014

UMontana Astrobiology
New graduate student positions at the NASA Astrobi-

for Fall 2015)
Overview:
The NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI) at the Uni-
versity of Montana is seeking outstanding graduate stu-
dents interested in pursuing research related to the evo-
lution of biological complexity. Research assistantships
(NIH scale) are available to work on projects led by
Scott Miller, Matt Herron and Margie Kinnersley. NAI
students will join the robust and collaborative Evolu-December 1, 2014 EvolDir 65
tionary Genetics and Genomics Group, a diverse set of
UM faculty using genetic and genomic approaches to
investigate evolutionary processes in plants, animals,
and microbes. Funding is also available for short-
or long-term travel to the UM-NAI partner labs of
Vaughan Cooper (U New Hampshire), Shelley Copley
(U Colorado, Boulder), Gavin Sherlock (Stanford U),
and Paul Sniegowski (U Pennsylvania). Students will
also have the opportunity to interact with Montana
NAI team leader Frank Rosenzweig, Montana NAI co-
Investigator John McCutcheon, as well as with theo-
retical biologists Eric Smith (Santa Fe Institute) and
Phil Gerrish (U New Mexico), who will be summer
scholars-in-residence at Montana and Pennsylvania, re-
spectively.
Program Description:
It is now widely recognized that not just competitive,
but also cooperative interactions are fundamental fea-
tures of biological systems ranging from enzymes to
organelles, cells and societies of cells and organisms.
The Montana NAI consists of eight projects organized
around ve questions related to how such interactions
inuenced major transitions in the history of Life: (1)
How do enzymes and metabolic networks evolve? (2)
How did the eukaryotic cell come to be, specically the
cell that contained a mitochondrion? (3) How do sym-
bioses arise? (4) How does multicellularity evolve? and
(5) How do pleiotropy, epistasis and mutation rate con-
strain the evolution of novel traits? A unifying theme
underlying these questions is: how do cooperative vs.
competitive interactions play out in driving major tran-
sitions that occur when independently replicating enti-
ties combine into a larger, more complex whole?
Project Descriptions:
Consequences of recA duplication for recombi-
nation, genome stability and tness (PI Scott
Miller; Scott.Miller@mso.umt.edu; www.cas.umt.edu/-
dbs/labs/miller/ ):
Despite the importance of homologous recombination
during the proliferation of biological diversity, we still
have a poor understanding of the balance of its creative,
stabilizing and destabilizing contributions to organis-
mal tness and genome evolution. Addressing this issue
hinges on understanding the regulation of the expres-
sion and activity of the recombinase A (recA) gene fam-
ily, an ancient gene family that plays a central role in
HR-mediated processes in all three domains of life. We
will use the extraordinary genetic variation exhibited
by duplicated recA gene copies in the genomes of the
cyanobacterium Acaryochloris as a model to address
both the impact of recA copy number on recombina-
tion and tness and whether Acaryochloris RecA par-alogs have specialized for dierent sub-functions. With
the recent development of genetic tools for these organ-
isms that enables us to manipulate recA copy number,
the Acaryochloris system presents a unique opportunity
to gain novel insights on the tness consequences that
emerge from the interplay between HR-mediated main-
tenance of genome stability, selectively favored gene du-
plications and non-adaptive genomic rearrangements.
The evolution of complexity via multicel-
lularity and cell dierentiation (PI Matt
Herron; matthew.herron@mso.umt.edu;
rosenzweig.dbs.umt.edu/people/matthew-herron/):
How and why organismal complexity increases are cen-
tral questions in evolutionary biology. Although the
vast majority of life forms remain simple, both the
maximum and the average levels of complexity have
increased from the origin of life to the present day.
Large increases in organismal complexity resulted from
a series of events in which existing individuals com-
bined to become parts of a new kind of individual with
components specialized for various roles. Such events
are known as major transitions and include the emer-
gence of cellular life from groups of interacting molec-
ular replicators, of eukaryotes from two prokaryotes, of
multicellular organisms from unicells, and of eusocial
'superorganisms' from individual animals. Among such
transitions, the evolution of multicellular organisms
from single-celled ancestors set the stage for unprece-
dented increases in complexity, especially in land plants
and animals. We have used the unicellular green alga
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to experimentally generate
de novo origins of simple (undierentiated) multicellu-
larity in two separate experiments. Using these newly-
evolved, multicellular Chlamydomonas, we plan to as-
certain the genetic bases

degrees (Master's or Ph.D.) in my lab at the Univer-
sity of Toronto, Canada's top-ranked research univer-
sity. Graduate projects would focus on the genomics of
avian hybrid zones in Amazonian birds. The positions
would begin in September 2015 and would involve eld
work (collecting genetic samples in Amazonian Brazil),
lab work (developing genetic datasets using next gen-
eration sequencing methods that sample broadly across
the genome), and bioinformatics type analyses (the ge-
nomics of reproductive isolation).
Hybrid zones provide a rare window into the evolu-
tion of reproductive isolation and the formation of new
species. To date, few hybrid zones have been analyzed
from the tropics and no avian hybrid zones have been
analyzed genetically from the species rich Amazonian
forests. Over the past three years my lab has located
twelve previously undescribed hybrid zones in the Ama-
zon, have begun sampling these zones, and have devel-
oped large genomic datasets for these species. This
is an exciting time to join the lab because students
will have an opportunity to join an already established
project, work with cutting edge genetic technologies
and datasets, and learn the bioinformatics tools and
methods required to analyse genomic data in an evolu-
tionary context.

UZurich ParallelOrchidSpeciation
2 PhD positions - The genetics of parallel pollinator-
driven ecological speciation in orchids
Two PhD positions are open for highly motivated stu-
dents with a keen interest in evolutionary and eco-
logical questions, and a solid knowledge of (1) bioin-
formatics/statistics/genomics or (2) molecular biol-
ogy/biochemistry.
The successful candidates will be part of a team in-
vestigating the molecular basis of parallel pollinator-
mediated reproductive isolation and ecological specia-
tion between sexually deceptive orchids of the genus
Ophrys. The project seeks to understand the degree
of convergence, at the phenotypic and molecular lev-
els, of two cases of species divergence mediated by the
same pollinators. This multidisciplinary project will
involve a combination of eld experiments, chemical
ecology, metabolomics, population genetics, ecological
genomics, bioinformatics, evolutionary analysis, trans-
genesis (in Arabidopsis), molecular biology and enzyme
biochemistry, to address fundamental questions about
the repeatability of evolution. For background infor-
mation on the study system, please see e.g. Schl uter &
Schiestl (2008, Trends Plant Sci.) and Schl uter & al.
(2011, PNAS).
The two main components of the project, each ad-
dressed by one PhD student, focus on (1) a eld and
ecological genomics approach utilising exome and RNA
sequencing involving an in-depth analysis of candidate
genes and metabolic pathways involved in the produc-
tion of pollinator-relevant traits; (2) identication and
key genes and specic mutations underlying repeated
adaptations, and in-depth analysis of their biochemi-
cal functions, their regulation, evolutionary origin and
ecological eect.
The ideal candidates should be highly motivated and
able to articulate their motivation for this project
clearly. S/he should be well organised, with a thor-
ough understanding of evolutionary biology, popula-
tion genetics and molecular biology. Moreover, can-
didates for position (1) are expected to have program-
ming/analysis skills (knowledge of R is required, knowl-
edge of C/C++, Delphi or other languages are a plus)
and a proven experience in bioinformatics, ideally withan ecological genomics background. Candidates for
position (2) should have ample experience in molec-
ular laboratory techniques, such as molecular cloning
and RNA work, and ideally protein work (expres-
sion/purication/Westerns/enzyme work), plant trans-
formation and subcellular protein localisation (e.g.
GFP). For both positions, prociency in English and
good communication skills are essential, as is an MSc
degree (or equivalent) in biology, biochemistry, or a re-
lated discipline, and the proven ability to carry out re-
search independently.
We oer two 3-year PhD positions at the University
of Zurich, Switzerland, funded by the Swiss National
Science Foundation. The students will be part of the
Institute of Systematic Botany, located in the beautiful
Botanic Gardens and within walking distance of Lake
Zurich. The successful candidates will work in a young,
active and interdisciplinary environment and will have
access to state-of-the-art tools and techniques. Applica-
tions should be made via the Life Science Zurich Gradu-
ate School (http://www.lifescience-graduateschool.ch/-

AvianPhenotypicVariation
MSc thesis opportunity Behavioural Ecology group,
Wageningen University, The Netherlands
Mate preference in great tits - a matter of taste? We are
looking for MSc students to work on an exciting project
testing birds for mate preferences in winter (experi-
ments), and studying reproductive investment in nest-
ing great tits in the spring (eldwork). Female choice
for top quality males is expected to result in the evolu-
tion of exaggerated male secondary sexual characters.
A strong directional preference for the 'best' males and
their specic heritable traits would theoretically cause
a fast decline in genetic variation among males. In nat-
ural populations under sexual selection however, diver-
sity in ornaments and genes is still present. How, then,
is genetic variation within populations maintained in
the presence of sexual selection? Our project proposes
that individuals may vary in their mate preference.
Variation in mate preferences may weaken the strong
directional selection on ornaments and thereby it may
allow diversity to persist.
Mate preferences Which characters are important when
females choose males? Do males choose attractive fe-
males? Which characters are important to them? Do
individuals vary in their preference? Does this variation
depend on the choosers' own characteristics? Starting
from December 2014 or January 2015
Reproductive investment Which characters inuence
reproductive investment? Do individuals nd a part-
ner with characters that meet their previously tested
preferences? How does the dierence between partner
preference and the actual partner inuence reproduc-
tive investment and extra-pair paternity? Starting from
March or April 2015

thought to play a major role in formation of new
species. However the extent to which individual re-
productive isolating barriers related to habitat dier-
entiation contribute to total isolation is not very clear.
Here, you will address these questions through an in-
depth analysis of the population structure and repro-
ductive isolation between grassland and forest popula-
tions of the distylous Primula veris. Recent research
has revealed remarkable dierences in oral morphol-
ogy (ower size, anther-stigma separation) and other
plant traits (leaf size, oral display) between forest and
grassland populations. Concomitant to changes in o-
ral morphology forest populations consistently owered
one month earlier than grassland populations. Imper-
fect positioning of the sexual organs combined with
dierences in owering time can be hypothesized to
constitute important reproductive barriers that hamper
gene ow and lead to reproductive isolation. Moreover,
dierences in shade and drought tolerance can be ex-
pected to contribute further to reproductive isolation.
To investigate whether specic adaptations to distinct
habitats are sucient to lead to the formation of re-
productively isolated species, you will combine detailed
molecular genetic analyses and genomic tools with pol-
lination and translocation experiments.
Description of the organizational unit
You will be welcomed in an international research
group of 15 PhD researchers and 11 postdoctoral re-
searchers. The lab oers a dynamic and intellectually
challenging environment, in close collaboration with ex-
perts from a wide variety of domains (for more details,
see: http://bio.kuleuven.be/eebcs/plant-conservation-
and-population-biology/ ). The KU Leuven is one of
Europe's leading research universities, with English as
the working language for research. Leuven lies just east
of Brussels, at the heart of Europe. The city is less than
two hours travel from Paris, London and Amsterdam.
Oer
We oer a 1 year full-time PhD scholarship with possi-
bility to extend to a full 4 year PhD following positive
evaluation.
Prole
* A relevant master degree (Biology / Bioscience Engi-

Cluster Hire in Geographic Ecology: three positions
at the rank of Assistant, Associate, or Full Professor
http://GE.ou.edu The Department of Biology at the
University of Oklahoma invites applications for three
tenured/tenure-track faculty positions at any rank, be-
ginning in fall 2015. We are searching for creative, col-
laborative thinkers who use integrative approaches to
address fundamental ecological questions at regional to
global scales. Our ultimate goal is to enhance our ex-
pertise in geographical and aquatic ecology toward pre-
dicting ecological and evolutionary responses to global
change. The search is open to theoretical, lab, and eld
biologists working on any taxa. In this cluster hire, we
seek:
* A Geographical Ecologist who studies phenomena at
multiple spatial scales toward understanding large-scale
patterns and processes. Innovators in biogeography,
macroecology, bioinformatics, and global ecology are
especially encouraged to apply.
* An Aquatic Ecologist who studies freshwater ecosys-
tems toward predicting the role of changing water sup-
plies on ecosystem services. Innovators in biogeochem-
istry, ecological networks, ecological genomics, river-
reservoir systems and land-water interactions are es-
pecially encouraged to apply.
* A Physiological Ecologist who studies the origin
and maintenance of ecological traits and their ultimate
role in the dynamics of population and ecosystem re-
sponses to a changing environment. Innovators study-
ing traits involved in metabolic, stoichiometric, thermal
and water-related variation and adaptation are espe-
cially encouraged to apply.
We are especially interested in candidates who use or
combine some of the following three approaches in their
work. The rst is development and/or testing of mod-
els and theory that connect phenomena at scales from
local to global. The second is an integrative use of data-
from gene frequencies to biogeochemistry, species dis-
tributions to climate past and future, functional traits
to landscapes-to advance theory and identify novel pat-
terns and processes. The third is a desire to apply this
research to ameliorating outstanding ecological prob-
lems, including climate change, biodiversity loss, dwin-December 1, 2014 EvolDir 103
dling water supplies, and the degradation of ecosystem
services.
The University of Oklahoma is committed to building
an international center of excellence exploring the geo-
graphical ecology of our evolving biosphere. Successful
candidates will join colleagues across campus, including
cluster hires in the EPSCoR initiative Adapting socio-
ecological systems to increased climate variability. Our
shared goal is to build theoretical and empirical bridges
across the sciences, to predict the interplay between bi-
otic and climatic changes, and to better steward our
natural resources and services. Join us.
How to Apply Successful candidates will have a Ph.D.
degree and a record of outstanding achievement as
evidenced by publications. Preferred candidates will
have a promising (assistant) or externally funded (as-
sociate/full) research program and the ability to lead
interdisciplinary, multi-investigator projects across a
range of geographic scales. Each individual will be ex-
pected to provide excellent training for graduate stu-
dents and postdocs, and contribute to undergraduate
and graduate teaching (one course per semester) in the
department.
Applicants should submit a cover letter, complete
curriculum vitae, research and teaching statements,
and selected reprints/preprints as PDF les to Chair,
Geographical Ecology Search Committee, at biolo-
gyjobs@ou.edu. Applicants should also arrange to
have three signed letters of reference sent to biol-

AGAJOH@oregonstate.eduBird masturbation
Dear colleagues,
My co-authors and I are trying to survey which species
of birds masturbate for a phylogenetic analysis. There
is a pretty good literature on masturbation in mam-
mals, but hardly anything on birds. As there are sev-
eral theories about why masturbation has evolved, we
would be extremely grateful if anyone who is very fa-
miliar with behaviour in a particular bird species would
be willing to complete the following survey and send it
back to me at: t.price@liverpool.ac.uk
Many thanks, and sorry for the unusual request.
Tom Price, University of Liverpool
Questionnaire about masturbation in birds What we
want to know: Please tell us about any bird species
you have seen masturbate, or any species where you
are reasonably condent you would have observed mas-
turbation if it occurred regularly in that species. If you
are expert in multiple species, it would be great if you
would tell us about as many of them as you can, using
multiple sheets if you want, or focus on the species you
are most condent about. Feel free to answer N/A or
\don't know" to any of the questions below.
The behaviour we are looking for: We dene masturba-
tion as a bird having sex with an inanimate object or
their own body (e.g. beak). Birds typically masturbate
by rubbing their cloaca against an inanimate object,
often a rock, branch, or something in their cage. This
may lead to ejaculation in males.
Species of bird:
Have you observed masturbation by a bird of this
species (Y/N)?
If not, how condent are you that you would have seen
it if it occurred (very/fairly/not very/not condent)?
If you did see masturbation in this species: What was
the sex of the birds that masturbated (M/F/both)?
Approximately how many individuals of this species
have you seen masturbate?
Were they in captivity (captive/wild)?
Were they solitary (alone/with same sex/with opposite
sex/with both sexes)?
Were they hand reared (hand/parent)?December 1, 2014 EvolDir 107
Were they adult (juvenile/adult)?
Do you consider the bird(s) to have been in good con-
dition (good/bad)?
Are there any other details you think we should know?

ResearchExchanges
Dear colleagues,
We invite interested scientists to apply for a
<3week research exchange sponsored by our NSF-
funded Research Coordination Network (http://-ideas.princeton.edu ) focused on the evolutionary bi-
ology of infectious diseases. We are interested in
supporting exchanges that promote collaborative re-
search on the evolutionary trajectories of parasites and
pathogens. A research exchange is designed to allow
researchers the opportunity to spend time working in-
tensively away from their home institution, within a
group with complementary expertise, to investigate the
evolutionary biology of infectious diseases.
Two examples of possible research exchanges: 1) A re-
search exchange could involve a theoretician visiting
an empiricist's lab to learn more about how data are
collected, integrate that knowledge into models they
have already developed, run in silico experiments to
test competing hypotheses, and jointly design the next
experiment to be undertaken by the empiricist. 2) A re-
search exchange could involve two empiricists bringing
new datasets from dierent systems to a theoretician's
lab to provide a reality check for models, jointly test the
t between model and data and answer new questions
about biology across systems.
We request a concise application to include: your pro-
posed research, with whom you propose collaboration
and why, where the work will take place and an esti-
mated budget (travel/subsistence).
Eligibility: Anyone is eligible, however exchanges will
be awarded preferentially to meritorious PhD students
and postdocs. International participants are welcome.
First application deadline: December 15, 2014 (quar-
terly thereafter)
Where to submit an application: Please visit our web-
site in order to submit an application electronically or
for further information: http://ideas.princeton.edu/-

ECRpaper tweets108 EvolDir December 1, 2014
Dear Evoldir,
We are excited to announce a new initiative called
#ECRpaper launching this Thursday (tomorrow)! We
hope all of you will participate in this initiative de-
scribed below and in this blog post on INNGE's
blog http://www.innge.net/?q=3Dnode/379 . Tweet-
able summary: \#ECRpaper - every Thursday -
tweet early career papers with a topical hashtag -
read them herehttp://www.innge.net/ecrpaper" Back-
ground: The amount of work published each month is
staggering. Many of us understandably resort to scan-
ning tables of contents for big names. This is unfor-
tunate for early career researchers because our work is
being overlooked. It is also unfortunate for the progress
of science because it means the ideas of fresh thinkers
are being overlooked. Work done by early career re-
searchers foretells the directions our elds are moving
and often showcases cutting edge techniques. There-
fore, we think it is particularly important that we{those
early in our careers{read work by our peers.
#ECRpaper: We think it is time to improve the expo-
sure of early career papers by using the power of Twit-
ter for the good of early career scientists and science in
general. Here's our suggested solution:
Every Thursday afternoon, tweet about a paper with
an early career researcher as the primary author. In-
clude #ECRpaper and a topical hashtag as well as the
twitter handle of the author if available.
An easy place to read all these tweets in one place
will be on INNGE's #ECRpaper aggregator (http:/-
/innge.net/ecrpaper), which organizes tweets by eld
of study.
Here's what we hope to achieve with #ECRpaper: -
Foster debate and discussion about research by early
career scientists -Build connections among early career
researchers and expand their colleague networks -Help
early career researchers see directions other early career
researchers are moving -Help everyone see the directions
their elds are moving -Bring publicity to work by early
career scientists
You do not have to be an early career researcher to join
this movement. Scientists from all career stages are en-
couraged to participate. We all benet when early ca-
reer scientists are supported to do the best work they
can.
Now is the time to think about the paper you want to
tweet on Thursday.
We hope to see you there,

CallApplications
**Godfrey Hewitt Mobility Award 2015 V Call for Ap-
plications**
Godfrey Hewitt (1940-2013) was President of the Eu-
ropean Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB) from
1999-2001. He was exceptionally inuential in evolu-
tionary biology both through his research and through
his mentoring of young scientists. He was also a great
believer in seeing organisms in their environment rst-
hand and in exchanges of ideas between labs. There-
fore, ESEB has decided to oer, annually, mobility
grants for young scientists in his name.
Closing date: Friday 16 January 2015, 12.00 GMT.
Eligibility:
The award is open to PhD students or postdoctoral
scientists who are, at the closing date for applications,
both within 6 years of the start date of their PhD and
ESEB members. The maximum single award will be
2000 Euros. It must be used to support eldwork or
a period of research at a lab that you have not previ-
ously visited. There is no restriction on the country
of residence or nationality of the applicant but prefer-
ence will be given to applicants who are unlikely to be
able to fund the proposed work by other routes. Pref-
erence will also be given to self-contained or seed-corn
projects, rather than fundamental elements of already-
funded PhD or postdoctoral projects, and to projects
with a denable output that is achievable within the
scope of the GHM award. A report will be required by
30 April 2016, by which time the funds must have been
used.
Application procedure:
Your application should be sent as a single PDF le
to Ute Friedrich at the ESEB oce, oce@eseb.org.
It should include your name, current status and insti-
tution, your PhD start date, your ESEB membership
number, a description of the work to be carried out
(maximum 500 words), an outline budget with brief
justication (maximum 100 words) and a signed state-December 1, 2014 EvolDir 109
ment from your PhD supervisor or postdoctoral adviser
(maximum 100 words) explaining why the work cannot
be funded from your institution.
Applications will be considered by a committee chaired
by Roger Butlin. The aim will be to announce decisions
before the end of March 2015.

mtDNA mismatch distribution
Hello,
I am working with two distinct mtDNA clades, each
of which is predominated by a major haplotype. Clade
'A' has numerous 1-step mutations away from the main
A type with a couple of 2-3 step mutations. Clade 'B'
has fewer 1-step mutations from the main B type with
a single 2 step haplotype. I have tried running BEAST
with little success (lack of convergence, I think due to
the simplistic nature of the network). I have also tried
estimating time of population expansion for the two
clades individually from mismatch distributions and get
a more recent event for A (the more variable of the two)
than for B. I am certain this is not a data formatting
error, but the expectation would be the more variable
should have the older time of expansion. Any thoughts?

MuLV resistance Mice
To whom it may concern;
I am trying to locate any tissue or DNA from mice
carrying the resistance allele Fv-4r or Akvr-1, which
confers resistance to murine leukemia virus (MuLV).
We are screening a wild population of mice for the fre-
quency of this allele via PCR and need a positive con-
trol. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Matt Rasmussen, Counsyl Mathematical and visual-
ization tools for working with ancestral recombination
graphs Tuesday, December 16, 2014, 10:00 AM PST
The elds of phylogenetics and population genetics
share several important models including gene trees,
species trees, ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs),
and pedigrees. These models are all closely related and
can be viewed as subgraphs of one another. Amongst
them, the ARG is particularly central and if inferred ef-
ciently can enable many applications such as inference
of selection and demography. Here, I will review vari-
ous helpful mathematical tools for working with ARGs,
including what we call the threading algorithm, the
branch graph, and the leaf trace visualization.

Shorebird DNA samples
Request for tissue or blood samples from shorebirds
(Charadriiformes)
I am seeking tissue or blood samples from shorebird
species (sandpipers, plovers and allies), and would ap-
preciate if anyone having such samples will contact me.
My PhD project focuses on genetic diversity and dier-
entiation in shorebirds, and using microsatellite mark-
ers, I am planning to compare various estimates of di-
versity and gene ow between dierent shorebird pop-
ulations throughout the world. I already have an ex-
cellent set of samples from 15 species collated by my
supervisors, however, I wish to top up these samples
with others.
To quantify genetic diversity and gene ow, I require
samples from a minimum of 20 breeding individuals
(males and female) from three+ breeding populations
which are approx. 100 km apart. With these sam-
ples we will test whether geographic latitude, popula-
tion size and distribution may inuence the extent of
genetic diversity and gene ow.
Since collecting these samples often requires substantial
eort, we are oering co-authorship to anyone willing to
contribute 20+ individual samples. Please note that we
only need breeding individuals, so all samples should be
gathered on the breeding ground. For statistical analy-
ses, we will need the date and geographic coordinate of
the sample, and sex and/or age (adult/juvenile) of the
individual. However, if necessary, we can use molecular
techniques to sex the individual.
Please contact Josie D'Urban Jackson
(jduj20@bath.ac.uk) if you have samples (feather,
blood, tissue) from any shorebird species, and are
willing to share them and please send samples to Prof.
Mike Bruford, OnE Division, C5.15, The Sir Martin
Evans Building, Museum Avenue, Cardi, CF10 3AX,
UK.
We would be happy to create a formal agreement spec-
ifying the use of the samples and will only deal with
samples that were taken under permit. For blood sam-
ples, we require a letter which includes a vet's certicate
from the region where the samples are found and conr-
mation if they have had 30 minutes treatment at 56^ aC
or not.Best wishes,

\ExpandTree: Spatio-temporal colonization patterns
in expanding tree populations: an integrated genetic
and genomic approach". The work is based in INRA-
Avignon (France) for up to 1 year and in CIBIO/InBio
(Portugal) up to another year starting early 2015.
Shorts stays at the hosting-collaboration Integrative
Ecology Group (IEG, Estaci on Biol ogica de Do nana,
CSIC, Spain) are also contemplated supervised by Prof.
Pedro Jordano.
Project overview and description of the position
Understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of ex-
panding populations is central to predict the responses
of fragmented forest populations to drivers of global
change. The main tasks of the postdoctoral researcher
consist in implementing recent statistical methods and,
ideally, developing new evolutionary models, that use
georeferenced genotypic and phenotypic data to un-
derstand demographic dynamics and gene ow pat-
terns in the colonisation front of expanding popula-
tions of trees inhabiting heterogeneous environments.
Two Mediterranean tree species currently undergoing
demographic expansions will be studied: (i) Junipe-
rus phoenicea subsp. turbinata in Reserva Biol ogica
de Do nana (Huelva, Spain) in collaboration with Pedro
Jordano's team (CSIC, Spain) and (ii) Cedrus atlantica
on Mont-Ventoux (Avignon, France, in collaboration
with Sylvie Oddo-Muratorio-Fran cois Lef evre's team).
Microsatellites are the primary genotypic markers but
the development and analysis of SNPs potentially under
selection are also planned in the ExpandTree project.
Specic goals within the framework of the project en-
tailing genetic, spatial, demographic, and ecological
data can be accommodated to the skills and interests
of the successful candidate.
Skills required: an excellent quantitative and computa-
tional background in spatial population genetics mod-elling applied to ecological issues. Interest in move-
ment ecology, eco-evolutionary dynamics and statistical
methodology of molecular data for ecology. Experience
in analysing SNPs and phenotypic data based on asso-
ciation models would be appreciated.
Prociency in written and spoken English is mandatory.

The School of Biology at the Georgia Institute of Tech-
nology has a growing research group in evolutionary
genomics; openings in three collaborating laboratories
are posted below:
| The Yi lab has open positions for graduate stu-
dents and postdoctoral researchers. Potential projects
in the Yi lab include 1) epigenomic evolution of hu-
man brains; we aim to identify DNA methylation, post-
translational modication, and histone modications
specic to human brains, and their impacts on neu-
ropsychiatric disorders. 2) Chromosome evolution in
the context of behavior; we examine sequence evolution,
epigenetics and transcriptomes of a vertebrate model
system to elucidate the co-evolution between these com-
ponents, and how they aect complex phenotypes. 3)
Phylo-epigenomics, to systematically analyze evolution
of epigenetic modication systems across deep phylo-
genies, and specically answer how natural selection
shapes various epigenetic landscapes across taxa. Mo-
tivated students who are ready to embrace the use
of next-generation sequencing methods and computa-
tional analyses to tackle new and exciting questions
should contact Soojin Yi (soojinyi@gatech.edu).
| The Lachance Lab has one open postdoctoral posi-
tion in human population genomics. Funding is avail-
able for two years. The Lachance Lab uses a mix
of whole genome sequencing and computational biol-
ogy to understand how evolutionary history impacts
the risk of hereditary disease across diverse human
populations. Potential projects include: 1) studying
fast evolving regions of the human genome in African
and non-African populations, 2) developing evolution-
ary models of hereditary disease risk, and 3) determin-
ing how genetic architecture and evolutionary history
contribute to health disparities. The ideal candidate
will have a background in population genetics, genetic
epidemiology, or computational biology. Please send
any enquiries to (joseph.lachance@biology.gatech.edu).

BIOINFORMATICS/COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
STARTING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
Dynamic postdoctoral research fellow sought to work on
*Streptococcus pneumoniae* population genomics with
Professors Marc Lipsitch and Bill Hanage in the Cen-
ter for Communicable Disease Dynamics, Department
of Epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health. The
fellow would work on two separate, NIH R01-funded
projects:
1. Analyzing the genomes of ~800 pneumococci from
carriage studies in Native American populations in the
US Southwest with research questions related to de-
tecting natural selection for diversication and/or loss
of antigens (PI Lipsitch collaboration with Johns Hop-
kins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Wellcome
Trust Sanger Institute) and analysis of the relation
between measured preexisting antipneumococcal anti-
body in participant sera and genome composition of the
pneumococci they subsequently carry.
2. Analyzing the genomes of ~1500 pneumococci from
the CDC's Active Bacterial Core Surveillance for in-
vasive disease, aiming to identify the factors in the
genome or environment that lead to the success of
antimicrobial-resistant strains (PI Hanage, collabora-
tion with CDC).
We seek a recent PhD in biology, computational biol-
ogy, population genetics, microbiology or bioinformat-
ics (or related eld) with experience in as many as pos-
sible of the following: Assembly, alignment and annota-
tion of whole genome sequences from NGS short reads,
phylogenetic methods, population genetics, and statis-
tical methods. Successful applicants need not have allDecember 1, 2014 EvolDir 119
of these but must be prepared to learn them. Inter-
est in and experience of experimental microbiology or
molecular biology is an additional plus.
Attractive features of this position include two large
and unexplored datasets with unusually good epidemi-
ologic data; the opportunity to test hypotheses gen-
erated from sequence analysis by experiment as both
PIs have wet labs (either alone or in collaboration with
others in the group); a highly collaborative, produc-
tive and friendly group within CCDD including ex-
pertise in many relevant elds, mostly concentrated
around the intersection of infectious disease epidemiol-
ogy, pathogen genomics, and mathematical modeling;
and opportunities to learn some of these complemen-
tary skills during the course of the project.
Appointment is for 2 years, subject to satisfactory per-
formance in the rst, with possibility of renewal.

HarvardU EvolutionOfRegeneration
Postdoctoral positions are available in the lab of
Mansi Srivastava at the Department of Organismic
and Evolutionary Biology, Harvard University (http:/-
/oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/Srivastava/srivastava-
oeb.html).
Positions are available for postdoctoral candidates with
experience in varied elds, including developmental bi-
ology, stem cell biology, molecular and cell biology,
computational biology, and evolution. A diversity of
potential research projects, ranging from in vivo stud-
ies of stem cell biology in regeneration to functional
studies of embryonic development in acoels, are avail-
able. Please send an email describing your research
background and interests as well as a curriculum vitae
to Mansi (mansi@oeb.harvard.edu).Research Summary:
Most animals are able to repair wounds and many can
regenerate extensively, re-growing organs or even entire
body plans from small fragments. Very little is known
about how wounding results in repair and/or regener-
ation, or whether these mechanisms are similar across
diverse animal species. The lab will take an integrative
approach for studying wound response and stem cell
biology during regeneration in an evolutionary frame-
work by using a broad range of techniques including
transcriptional proling and lineage tracing.
A major focus of the lab will be the three-banded pan-
ther worm, Hofstenia miamia, an acoel species that is
a new model system for studies of regeneration and de-
velopment. Acoels are likely to be the earliest lineage
of animals with bilateral symmetry (bilaterians), and
are therefore in a phylogenetically informative position
for understanding the evolution of regenerative mech-
anisms. Hofstenia has many advantages as a model
regenerative species, for example: RNAi that can be
administered by soaking; tools for studying gene func-
tion; and the ability to isolate stem cells. Hofstenia
also produces accessible embryos that enable compar-
isons of regeneration and development, and provide a
unique opportunity to use gene-delivery and genome-
editing tools to study regeneration.
Various projects are available for studying genetic and
cellular mechanisms underlying the wound response
and regulation of stem cells in Hofstenia as well as for
comparing regeneration between dierent regenerative
animal species including cnidarians and planarians. In
addition to uncovering new mechanisms, these studies
will aim to learn which aspects of animal regeneration
are conserved, and which evolved independently along
dierent animal lineages.

INRA France GrassAdaptation
A Postdoctoral position in Landscape genomics and
quantitative genetics for climate-change adapted grass-
lands available in France at INRA URP3F research unit
POSITION DESCRIPTION. The INRA URP3F re-
search unit is seeking for a post-doctoral researcher
to contribute to a European research network project
(GrassLandscape) aiming to discover genetic variabil-
ity involved in the climatic adaptation of a grassland
species (perennial ryegrass) at the scale of Europe.
The main objective of this post-doctoral research will
be to analyse SNP and phenotypic data released by
the project in combination with environmental data
(notably climatic data) extracted from ne-resolution
databases in order to detect signal of selection (i.e.
climate driven selection). Based on association mod-
els between genomic polymorphisms and environmental
variations, the candidate will (i) map the spatial distri-
bution of genomic markers linked to adaptive diversity
in present climatic conditions and (ii) foresee possible
shifts in the spatial range tting these markers in the
context of several climate change scenarios. Based on
these results, he will dene allelic proles expected to
provide climatic adaptation at regional scale over Eu-
rope under the foreseen future climatic conditions.
The post-doctoral fellow is expected to have a back-
ground in population and landscape genomics and to
have expertise in population genetics, statistics and
ecology. An experience in mining large databases and
in using Geographical Information Software would be
appreciated.
CONDITIONS. This post-doctoral position is oered
in the frame of the AgreenSkills postdoctoral fellow-
ship program. It is opened to young researchers having
less than 7 years of postdoctoral research experience
and having spent not more than 12 months in France
within the last 3 years. The appointment is for a three
years duration provisionally starting from September
1st 2015. Deadline for application is March 1st 2015
but it is advised to apply as soon as possible.
Candidates eligible to the AgreenSkills programme ben-
et from attractive working conditions (gross monthlysalary about ^ a:3500foryoungresearchers ):
The post-doctoral fellow will be hosted at the INRA
URP3F research unit in Lusignan (France) where he
will get direct support from the coordinator of the
project GrassLandscape (Jean-Paul Sampoux). The
fellow will also work in close collaboration with Pr.
St ephanie Manel (stays at her EPHE-BEV-CEFE lab
in Montpellier, France).
INRA URP3F has extensive experience in research aim-
ing to improve services provided by grasslands. It
combines skills in quantitative and population genet-
ics, plant breeding and genetic resource conservation,
plant eco-physiology and agronomy and it will thus of-
fer a stimulating interdisciplinary environment to the
fellow.
EPHE-BEV-CEFE aims to better understand biologi-
cal and ecological evolutionary processes in the evolu-
tionary dynamics of populations facing heterogeneous
environments in space and time (e.g. global change).
It has internationally recognized skills in landscape ge-

Lyon ViralBioinformaticsEvolution
Post-doctoral position in viral bioinformatics : Lyon,
France
We are welcoming applications from enthusiastic and
independent post-doctoral candidates to participate in
our ECOFECT LabEx grant-funded project. We will
develop a new bioinformatic approach to identify the
sites of the Dengue virus genome that interact with the
mosquito cell machinery.
Background To control the Dengue virus epidemics, the
most promising strategies target the mosquito host to
stop viral transmission to humans. However, it is very
hard to optimise these strategies and predict whether
they could be successful because little is known about
how the virus interacts with its mosquito host.
Project We will implement a new approach that com-
bines viral evolution experiments in mosquito cells
with deep sequencing runs (collaboration with Marlne
Dreuxs team). The postdoctoral project aims at devel-
oping bioinformatic and statistical methods to infer a
map of interactions between the mosquito cell machin-
ery and the viral genome. Doing so requires addressing
two important problems in viral bioinformatics, i/ the
assembly of viral haplotypes from short reads and ii/
tness prediction for assembled haplotypes.
Environment The host laboratory (LBBE) is a stimu-
lating and pleasant place to work, where one can meet
biologists, physicians, computer scientists, mathemati-
cians and statisticians working on problems that range
from ecology to medicine, through genomics and evo-
lution. In addition, the post-doctoral researcher will
enjoy close interactions with virologists in the team of
Marlne Dreux (CIRI, ENSLyon).
Lyon is the second largest city in France, is famous for
its food, is a UNESCO World Heritage site and enjoys
a very convenient central location in Europe.Candidates The applicants are expected to have a
strong background in bioinformatics or phylogenetics
or population genetics or computer science or statistics.
The ideal candidate should be highly motivated, curi-
ous and enthusiastic to work in a collaborative team.
Proven ability to identify research objectives and meet
agreed deadlines, self-motivation and exibility are es-
sential. Excellent written and oral skills in English are
required'.

MaxPlanck GenomicsMigration
Postdoctoral Position Genomics of Migration
My group combines several biological disciplines includ-
ing behavioural observation, evolutionary genomics,
molecular ecology, and bioinformatics, and utilises
emergent technologies to identify the genetic basis of
migratory traits.
Here we focus on identifying the genes and signaling
pathways behind the components shaping the migra-
tory phenotype in the blackcap, a well characterised
migratory songbird species. We will complement the se-
quencing approach with gene expression proling and
characterisation of chromatin modication to investi-
gate the extent of phenotypic variation manifested by
expression dierences, either through slight genetic dif-
ferences or epigenetic processes.
The key focus of this project is to understand: Which
genes harbour coding variation with relevant conse-
quences for migratory traits, and which signalling cas-
cades are involved in shaping the migratory phenotype?
Within this project that is funded through a Max
Planck Research Group Grant, I am oering a 2 year124 EvolDir December 1, 2014
postdoctoral position with the possibility for extension.
The postdoc will assume a central position within this
project that is funded through an independent Max
Planck Research Group Grant. Project start is Jan-
uary 2015 and the ideal starting date for the postdoc is
April 2015.
The ideal candidate has a biological training, back-
ground in bioinformatics with skills in programming
(scripts and analysis pipelines), next generation se-
quence analysis, genome assembly and annotation. The
successful candidate will be involved in fundamental re-
search questions on migratory genomics, and I highly
appreciate a creative postdoc who is motivated to con-
tribute to and extends our research agenda to under-
stand the genetic architecture of migratory traits.
The core dataset that will be generated includes Il-
lumina sequencing of the blackcap genome from pop-
ulations with varying migratory phenotypes, some of
which will be used for de novo genome assembly. The
expected output of the postdoc is to contribute to the
genome assembly and to compare the genomic makeup
and underlying signaling pathways of dierent popula-
tions with various migratory phenotypes.
We oer an English speaking and ambitious working en-
vironment at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary
Biology in Pl on, Germany. Cutting edge infrastructure
is available at all levels, including high-performance
computer clusters and next-generation sequencing core
facility. The Institutes main elds of work include evo-
lutionary ecology (Prof. Dr. M. Milinski), evolutionary
genetics (Prof. Dr. D. Tautz) and evolutionary theory
(Prof. Dr. A. Traulsen) and hosts a number of research

Department of Biological Sciences (DBS), National126 EvolDir December 1, 2014
University of Singapore
The Department of Biological Sciences (DBS), National
University of Singapore, is starting a research initia-
tive whose focus is the promotion of genomic, tran-
scriptomic, and population genomic tools in non-model
species that are studied throughout the department
(http://www.dbs.nus.edu.sg/). Three 3-year postdoc-
toral positions will be available from December 2014
onwards. Sought areas of expertise are the design and
analysis of NGS data used for comparative genomics,
transcriptomics, and population genomics of non-model
organisms.
Organisms living in the forests and oceans of South East
Asia have evolved chemical, morphological, and physi-
ological adaptations that we have barely begun to com-
prehend, many of these with currently unforeseen appli-
cations to human health, disease management, agricul-
ture, or technological developments. Improved access
to Next Generation Sequencing data and bioinformat-
ics will be instrumental for studying the genetic basis
of these adaptations as well as assessing and managing
the genetic biodiversity of populations and species in
the region. One of the most ecient ways to explore,
understand, catalogue, and conserve such unexplored
biodiversity is via genomic information. The key aim
of the initiative is to start new projects on particularly
striking phenotypes and to enable existing research on
non-model organisms in the DBS. As such the post-
doctoral fellows are expected to collaborate with DBS
students, postdocs, and faculty on the uses and analysis
of NGS data.
Postdoctoral candidates are invited to visit the lab
pages of DBS faculty (see examples below) to iden-
tify potential host labs that they wish to be associated
with for the development of specic research projects.
In addition, candidates are expected to contribute to
training in NGS design and analysis (ca. 20% of time).
Training includes providing help with experimental de-
sign and analysis of NGS data, and contributing to a
yearly training workshop. Please send a CV, a 2-page

Expected starting date: from March 2015
ANR-funded project PHEROMOD: Pheromones as
general modulators of insect behavior
In addition to their well-documented function as com-
munication signals, some pheromones have been re-
cently shown to play a role as 'modulators' of cognitive
phenomena, facilitating or inhibiting associative learn-
ing and memory both in vertebrates and invertebrates.
The project aims at investigating the modulator eect
of pheromones on experience-dependent behaviour of
three insect species, the honeybee Apis mellifera, the
ant Lasius niger and the moth Agrotis ipsilon, in or-
der to determine the mechanisms that are either con-
served across species or species-specic and associable
with particular life-styles. We will study the mecha-
nisms and adaptive value of pheromone modulation of
learning by using a behavioural approach and by fo-
cusing on octopaminergic and dopaminergic circuits,
which in many insects signal appetitive and aversive sit-
uations, respectively (pharmacological approach). As
odour coding changes after appetitive learning in ol-
factory centres of the insect brain, we will analyse if
pheromone exposure modies per se the odour code
in the rst olfactory relay (antennal lobe) of the three
species. A combination of pheromone/neutral odour
exposure and in vivo calcium imaging recordings of an-
tennal lobe activity will be used to this end. This re-

on how pheromones inuence learning performances in
three paradigmatic insect taxa.

Post-doc position in Evolutionary Ecology/Community
Ecology/Theoretical Ecology
\Adaptation and Resilience of Spatial Ecological Net-
works to human-induced changes"
Anthropogenic environmental changes increasingly
threaten biodiversity and ecosystem services, thus kin-
dling a societal demand for predictions that ecology
as a science has yet to answer. Available models are
poorly suited to predicting the ecological eects of such
changes because they ignore variation in species' niche
due to ecological interactions and evolution. Without
understanding the functioning of ecological networks
and how they are shaped by evolution, it is indeed dif-
cult to predict how changes of the environment will
cascade through ecosystems and make species traits
evolve. Understanding the dynamics of ecological net-
works is a dual goal, both for fundamental research and
for building informed programs on sustainable ecosys-
tem services and species conservation. Accounting for
species interactions and evolution to understand the
consequences of global changes is the critical question
we want to tackle through the post doc we propose here.
In this context, the post-doctoral fellow will develop
models linking the coevolution of traits to the struc-
ture of ecological networks (both trophic and mutual-
istic networks). Such models will especially account
for spatial aspects, i.e. heterogeneous landscapes anddispersal of individuals among habitat patches, and will
focus on the structure of ecological communities emerg-
ing from evolutionary processes acting at the landscape
scale. Modelling will be based on adaptive dynamics
and/or theoretical quantitative genetics methods.
Application Process
This job is supported by a larger ANR project AR-
SENIC (2015-2019) involving a network of 8 dierent
labs, most of them in France. More precisely, this po-
sition will involve collaborations between the Ecology,
Evolution & Paleontology lab in Lille and of the Insti-
tute of Ecology and Environmental Sciences in Paris.
The post-doctoral fellow will work at IEES Paris (Insti-
tute of Ecology and Environmental Sciences of Paris).
IEES is a new laboratory that merges dierent aspects
of ecology, such as evolutionary ecology, community
ecology and functional ecology. The post-doc fellow
would be part of the team \Ecology and Evolution of
Interaction Networks" (team leader: Nicolas Loeuille).
The post-doctoral position will particularly focus on
the theoretical developments proposed above. We wel-
come applications from candidates with a PhD in ecol-
ogy, evolutionary biology or applied mathematics, with
good skills in ecological modelling, theoretical ecology
and evolutionary ecology. Skills in game theory, adap-

the University of Arizona in Tucson. A popular tourist
destination surrounded on all four sides by mountain-
ous national and state parks, Tucson is a vibrant city
of nearly a million people with an attractive climate.
The EEB department in Tucson was ranked in the top
10 by US News & World Report.
The postdoc will study evolutionary rescue in the pres-
ence of clonal interference, via a model of asexual pop-
ulation genetics (based on Desai & Fisher 2007). This
model will be modied so that genotypes specify abso-
lute tness in a deteriorating environment, rather than
relative tness as is the norm in population genetics.
The project is part of a broader eort to integrate the
ecological density-dependence terms r and K with the
classical population genetics tness term of w, as part of
an eco-evo theoretical synthesis: see http://arxiv.org/-

can be combined to estimate biodiversity? 2) How does
uncertainty in estimates of biodiversity depend on the
types of sampling chosen? 3) How can local observa-
tions be combined with physical covariates and remote
sensing data to obtain regional inferences about biodi-
versity?
The position will be part of the Marine Biodiversity Ob-
servation Network project, funded by NASA, the Bu-

broad range of marine organisms in the Santa Barbara
Channel. The project benets from extensive existing
data about the biological and physical conditions in the
region which will be integrated over large spatial scales
using geostatistical models and remote sensing. This
integration will be supported by new genetic and imag-
ing techniques for observing marine biodiversity, also
being developed by the project. In addition, mathe-
matical models will be developed to examine the value
of information on biodiversity in making management
decisions, and to explore optimal allocation of resources
across dierent methods of sampling.
The candidate should have training in the elds of
quantitative ecology and expertise in spatial statistics
or geostatistics (a PhD in quantitative ecology, statis-
tics or related eld is required) and strong skills in
advanced statistical modeling, computational analysis,
and scientic programming. An ideal candidate will
have experience with quantication of multivariate spa-
tial heterogeneity, change of support, spatial regression
models, geostatistical prediction and simulation, and
spatial sampling design. The ability to handle large
amounts of data in a GIS environment is also an impor-
tant qualication. The candidate will be expected to

I am currently searching to ll 2 positions 1 for a
Ph.D. candidate and 1 for a postdoctorate candidate
for conducting a research project on the population ge-
nomics in the American lobster. The recruited candi-
dates would join the Canadian Research Chair in Ge-
nomics and Conservation of Aquatic Resources (Que-
bec City, Canada) directed by Louis Bernatchez, as
well as a multidisciplinary team combining expertise
in genomics, ecology and modelling. The main objec-
tive of this project is to generate new knowledge that
will contribute to maintaining the long-term sustain-
ability of lobster stocks (Homarus americanus), as well
as the major shery it supports throughout Eastern
Canada. This study aims at providing by means of the
most recent genomics tools combined with ecological
data and modelling, concrete results that can be ap-
plied towards new management and conservation poli-
cies for this species. More specically, the candidates
will be involved in the following research objectives:
i) Document neutral and potentially adaptive genomic
variation at large scale in order to test the concordance
between the natural population genetic structure and
administrative regions currently used to manage the
species; ii) Investigate the mechanisms responsible for
genetic dierentiation at small spatial scales by com-
paring the genetic structure of dierent life stages of
the species.
This will involve the use of Genotype-By-Sequencing
(GBS) methods, as well as bioinformatic treatment and138 EvolDir December 1, 2014
statistical analysis of large data base. The ideal candi-

ULouvain DuplicateEvolution
Postdoctoral Research Associate: Directed Evolution
of an Oligomeric Enzyme after Gene Duplication
University of Louvain, Life Sciences Institute, Louvain-
la-Neuve, Belgium
A postdoctoral research position is opened for a re-
search in molecular evolution of oligomeric enzymes.
It is generally accepted that oligomerisation is an ad-
vantage for complexifying the properties of a pro-
tein such as aording allosterism but the impact of
oligomerisation on the evolutionary mechanisms of pro-
teins is poorly documented. In this fundamental
project, we propose to experimentally tackle two ques-
tions. What is the advantage of oligomerisation for the
evolvability of a protein? Can we take advantage of the
combinatorial nature of oligomeric proteins for rapidly
evolving them in the lab? By simulating an evolution-
ary scenario starting by the duplication of a gene encod-
ing a model homomeric enzyme in E. coli, we will study
the potential of the system to evolve towards new func-
tions (specicity change, allostery) by introducing mu-
tations in both copies of the gene and we will evaluate
how paralogous heteromerisation between the encoded
proteins can promote enzyme evolution.
The position is for 18 monthes with a possible renewal.

UMaryland EvolutionaryGenomics
Mutation
Post Doctoral Position Available in the lab of Charlie
Fenster, University of Maryland
Collaborators: Stephen Wright (University of Toronto),
Matt Rutter (College of Charleston), Detlef Weigel
(Max Planck Institute, T ubingen).
The open postdoc position is an opportunity for the ba-
sic discovery of mutations. Specically, we seek a post-
doc that will use computational approaches to quantify
the mutational origins of genetic variation at the se-
quence level to further our understanding of the role of
mutation and selection as determinants of patterns of
genetic variation at the within and among species lev-
els. The postdoc will also have the opportunity to help
set-up the eld experiments to study de novo mutations
in the Swedish and French sites. The Weigel lab will
identify the mutations and the postdoc will analyze the
results. Funding is for 3 years. Preferred starting date
is April 1, 2015. Salary is in the low $ 40 K, but also
includes generous benets.
Briey, the role of mutation to evolutionary process de-
pends on the rate and type of mutation and the eects
that the new mutations have on tness. Yet how the ef-
fects of naturally occurring mutations both enable and
shape the evolution of diversity remains largely unex-
plored. Quantifying and analyzing these parameters
requires broad, integrative approaches. Recent concep-
tual and experimental advances now allow a more com-
prehensive treatment of the eects of mutations on evo-
lutionary diversication. In particular, whole-genome
sequencing is now so inexpensive that it is possible to
directly conrm and dene the action of mutation.
This postdoctoral position will be headquartered at the
University of Maryland, which is on the subway line
of the culturally vibrant Washington DC metropolitan
area. In addition to the interactions available in a top
100 world-wide ranking of research universities, there
are ample opportunities to exchange ideas with col-
leagues from NIH, USDA and the Smithsonian Insti-
tute. The postdoc is expected to be a key component
in the integration of the various labs. Consequently
there are incredible opportunities to collaborate with
one of the world's most productive plant molecular labs
(Weigel Lab including H. Burbano), a leader in the in-
tersection of genomics and evolution (Wright lab), andadditional leaders in theoretical and evolutionary ge-
netics and plant population ecology (J. Agren Uppsala
University, T. Lenormand CNRS Montpellier, and E.
Imbert University of Montpellier). We also oer the
opportunity to interact with one of the leading investi-
gators at the forefront of integrating outreach with ba-
sic research, a.k.a., broader impacts (Rutter lab). The
Fenster lab is diverse with interests and students span-
ning from plant oral evolution to evolutionary genet-
ics.
OUR SPECIFIC AIMS 1. To completely determine
mutations in 100 Arabidopsis thaliana mutation accu-
mulation (MA) lines that have already been associated
with tness measures in the eld 2. To completely de-
termine mutations in 320 lines from new MA lines that
originate from 8 novel genetic backgrounds derived from
native populations and whose tness will be measured
in the original founder eld sites as part of an ongoing
NSF funded project 3. To completely determine mu-
tations in 50 wild-collected plants from North Ameri-
can populations and additional herbarium specimens to
track a natural analog of a MA experiment 4. To use
the data from Aims 1-3 to quantify the rates of dierent
classes of mutation, of genetic background eects on
mutation, on the relationship between mutations and
tness, and on the contribution of mutation to dier-
entiation in nature 5. To develop a web-based educa-
tional tool for undergraduates that will explore recent
advances in the study of mutation This postdoc will
begin with an available data set reecting aim 1 above.
Thus we believe there is the opportunity for rapid publi-
cations spanning the elds of genomics, bioinformatics,
evolutionary modeling and with sequence and tness
data, the chance to discover new patterns with impor-
tant evolutionary consequences.

About the URPP Evolution in Action The University
Research Priority Program (URPP) \Evolution in Ac-
tion: From Genomes to Ecosystems" invites applica-
tions for an Academic Fellow position. Evolutionary
biology is a core area of biology and understanding
the underlying mechanisms is of crucial importance for
both basic and applied aspects of biology and medicine.
Beyond the biological and medical elds, evolution-
ary concepts are an important theme in the social
and economic sciences. The URPP Evolution in Ac-
tion is set in this wide area of research (see http://-
www.evolution.uzh.ch/index.html). It brings together
multiple research groups of the Faculty of Science, the
Faculty of Medicine, and the Faculty of Arts, and plays
an important integrative role for diverse disciplines at
the UZH.
Tasks This is an opportunity for young scientists to
pursue a period of independent research before takinga faculty position. The successful candidate will direct
his/her own research under the mentorship of a senior

on ecological studies for inferring adaptations to many
environmental conditions. These methods are mainly
based in the species comparison taking into account
the phylogenetic relationships between them, which is
useful to any kind of environment (terrestrial, aquatic)
and taxonomic group (vertebrates, invertebrates, fungi,
bacteria). The workshop will focus on theoretical as-
pects of comparative methods as well as discussion anal-
ysis sessions. On of the most important parts of the
workshop will the possibility to get advise for your own

WHERE: Weggis, Switzerland WHAT: Winter School
\Bioinformatics for Adaptation Genomics: Adaptation
genomics in the realm of Next-Generation Sequencing
data analysis" WHEN: 1 - 7 March 2015
The rapid development of next-generation sequencing
technologies and their application to adaptation ge-
nomics research holds great promise to increase our
understanding of genotype-phenotype-environment in-
teractions, and the pioneering ndings of recent years
have inspired the launching of genome-scale projects in
an ever-increasing number of organisms. A great ef-
fort has been made to develop software that can handle
the large datasets that typically characterise ecological
genomics studies, while still providing robust analytical
platforms for supporting their application in non-model
systems. However, due to the sheer number and com-
plexity of available packages, it is often dicult for in-
vestigators to assess the potential and limitations of al-
ternative methods, and determine which are best suited
for their particular question and dataset. This winter
school aims at providing an opportunity for investiga-
tors to gain insight into the rationale behind some of the
established analytical pipelines in adaptation genomics
research and acquire knowledge on the best practice to
perform analyses and experimental design.
The School aims to address primarily evolutionary bi-
ologists and bioinformaticians who want to gain deeper
knowledge on state-of-the-art methods to detect adap-
tive patterns from genome-wide nucleotide data. Ap-
plications from early career researchers (PhD and post-
doctoral level) as well as faculty with a background in
ecology, genetics, or bioinformatics will be considered.
The workshop is particularly aimed at candidates with
experience of the Unix environment and with previous
practice on analytical pipelines for genomic data. Par-
ticipants will be requested to bring their own laptop
with which to connect to the server for the practical
sessions. The school will have a limited number of par-
ticipants (ca. 30) and lecturers (5).
AIM & OBJECTIVES The Winter School provides an
opportunity for investigators to penetrate the ^ ablackbox' behind the complex approaches available for in-
vestigating adaptation genomics throughout the ana-
lytical pipeline; from the assumptions and requirements
necessary to produce a high quality SNP dataset from
raw next-generation sequence data, to the in-depth in-
terpretation of methods designed to detect signature
of selection, demographic patterns and associations be-
tween genotypes and environment, and/or phenotypes.
Specically, the following objectives will be addressed:
-the rationale and assumptions intrinsic to dierent
available analytical approaches
-comparison of the implementation and results of al-
ternative analytical methods as applied on the same or
similar datasets
-interpretation of the outputs from the programs at dif-
ferent stages in the analysis
-best practice to implement the available packages when
addressing dierent evolutionary questions, and how
this conditions experimental design
Lessons will include initial lectures on the theoretical
background of the programs and practical demonstra-
tions given by the instructor followed by hands-on exer-
cises performed by the participants under guided super-
vision. Computing activity will rely on individual con-
nections to the Genetic Diversity Centre (GDC, ETH
Zurich) server that will provide resources for demon-
strations and practical training. Emphasis will be given
to interpretation of the output of the programs, with
slots of discussion time allowed to facilitate interactions
between the instructor and the audience.
VENUE The school will be hosted at the Alexan-
der & Gerbi Hotel in Weggis, Switzerland (http://-
www.alexander-gerbi.ch). Weggis is a scenic town lo-
cated on the shore of Lake Lucerne in central Switzer-
land. The location was chosen to provide a friendly and
stimulating work environment. The area is known for
its relaxing character in a peaceful mountain scenery.
Full board (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and coee breaks)
and lodging in double rooms will be provided at the
Alexander & Gerbi Hotel during the workshop, and is
paid by ESF and ACE.
REGISTRATION We ask that all interested partic-
ipants submit a cover letter (1 page max) detailing
their research interests, their level of bioinformatics
experience, and motivation for attending the work-
shop, as well as their CV (2 pages max) to Bioin-
