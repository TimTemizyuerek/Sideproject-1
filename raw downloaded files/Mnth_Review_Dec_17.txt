Dear Colleagues,
It is our pleasure to invite you to the Pathobiome Con-
ference 2018 on 18-20 March 2018 in Ajaccio, Corsica
(France).
Pathobiome 2018 is the second edition of an in-
ternational symposium, which gathers the scientic
community that investigates the relationship between
pathogens, microbiota, and hosts in humans, animals
and plants. Abstract submission and registration at
https://colloque.inra.fr/pathobiome-2018/ The dead-
line has been extended to December 8th, 2017.
The pathobiome concept has emerged from the tri-
partite relationship between the pathogens, the sym-
bionts and the host that can dramatically inuence or
drive disease processes. This concept applying to a wide
range of ecosystems the scientic program will reect cut-
ting edge of current pathobiome research in mammals,
arthropods and plants in various elds (alternatives to
antibiotics and pesticides, microbial ecology, epidemiol-
ogy, microbial evolution, metagenomics, emerging dis-
eases, control strategies, epidemiology, mathematical
modelling; ). Beside the invited speakers, 18 scientic
presentations will be selected to illustrate cutting-edge
research in this fast-developing eld. Oral communi-
cation will be selected among the abstracts submitted.
The remaining abstracts will be selected for presentation
in the poster sessions.

10'V12 July 2018
Granlibakken, Lake Tahoe, CA, USA
https://www.newphytologist.org/symposia/42 Wood
biology research has traditionally been approached by
discipline-specic questions and approaches, but recently
the need and power of integrative approaches is be-
coming apparent. This symposium will bring together
diverse researchers from dierent aspects of wood bi-
ology research including anatomists, biochemists, cell
biologists, ecologists, geneticist / genomicists, and phys-
iologists.
This symposium aims to facilitate the exchange of ideas
and foster new collaborations across disciplines. We
will also challenge speakers to put forth their vision for
future research, including outstanding questions and
interdisciplinary approaches by which they could be
addressed.
The symposium will take place over three days at the
Granlibakken Resort at Lake Tahoe in California. The
symposium will be organised into sessions by research
topics, there will be dedicated time for discussions,
posters, selected poster talks, a conference dinner and a
eld trip.
Travel grants are available!

We are happy to inform you that abstract submission
is now open for next year's 2 ^nd Joint Congress on
Evolutionary Biology in Montpellier, France (18-22
August 2018). Joint Congresses take place every six
years and bring together four of the world's largest aca-
demic societies in the eld of evolutionary biology: the
European Society for Evolutionary Biology <http://-
eseb.org>, the American Society of Naturalists <http:/-
/www.amnat.org/ >, the Society for the Study of Evolu-
tion<http://www.evolutionsociety.org/ >and the Soci-
ety of Systematic Biologists <http://www.systbio.org/
>.
Following the traditional format of ESEB conferences,
*all contributed talks and posters will be submitted
to specic symposia and selected on the basis of their
abstract by symposium organizers*.
The list of symposia is available at:
http://evolutionmontpellier2018.org/symposia You can
consult the list and submit an application to give a talk
or poster to the symposia of your choice. You can sub-
mit applications to *up to two symposia* from the list.
Note that if none of the topics covered by the thematic
symposia matches your research, you will have the op-
tion to submit your abstract to the Open symposium
(also in the list).
If you are a graduate student, you will have the oppor-
tunity to compete for the Mayr Award and Hamilton
Award. These awards, organized respectively by SSB
and SSE, will be given to the presenter of an outstand-
ing student talk at the Joint meeting in Montpellier.
*If you want to compete for any of these awards, you
have to submit an abstract to either the Mayr Award
symposium or Hamilton Award symposium through the
normal abstract submission procedure*.
In order to allow as many participants as possible to
present their work, and in line with ESEB tradition,
*participants can submit only one abstract as the pre-
senting author (i.e. the person who will present the
talk/poster).* There is no limit, however, to the number
of talks/posters a given person may coauthor.
The symposium organizers of both your rst and second
choice will examine your proposal and make a selection.Symposium organizers will establish a priority list for
abstracts accepted as oral communications and will oer
the *option of presenting a poster instead of a talk* for
the abstracts that do not t in that list. Abstracts may
be rejected if they are of insucient quality, but our
general policy is to accept most poster presentations.
You will be chosen to present either a talk or a poster
in a maximum of one symposium.

Evolution 2018 and Grad Student Taxation
Two pieces of information from SSB: One relates to
the upcoming Evolution 2018 meeting in Montpellier,
France: all talks and posters must be accepted into a
symposium, and abstracts for these are due Jan. 15.
This includes student talks in the Mayr symposium.
This policy is common for ESEB meetings but unusual
for SSB/ASN/SSE meetings, so we are trying to call
attention to it (please tell your colleagues). Actual reg-
istration for the meeting happens later (once decisions
about talks and posters have been announced). If you
do not submit an abstract by Jan. 15, 2018, you will not
be giving a poster or talk at Evolution 2018. The other
is a letter by the SSE, ASN, and SSB presidents about
the eect of a proposed US tax plan on students study-
ing in the United States [see separate posting in the6 EvolDir December 1, 2017
EvolDir]. SSB has released other statements informing
the public about areas relating to our expertise, often
in conjunction with other scientic societies. See them

Montpellier SpeciesTheoryEvolution
Aug19-22
We are pleased to invite you to submit your abstracts
to the symposium \Species in the Theory of Evolution:
from Concepts to Methods and Applications" which will
be held during the Evolution 2018 meeting in Mont-
pellier, France. The objective of our symposium is
to provide a reappraisal of the position of taxonomy
in the recent conceptual and methodological advances
in evolutionary biology. We wish to gather scientists
working on the species level from dierent perspectives
including large taxonomic inventories, speciation -omics
and developmental genetics as well as on the theoret-
ical foundations of taxonomy and systematics. Our
invited speaker is Prof. Alessandro Minelli who will
give a talk on \Evolvability, modularity and innovation:
an evo-devo perspective on the evolution of diagnostic
characters between closely related species".
Summary of the symposium: Taxonomy the science that
divides organisms into taxonomic units is often viewed
as a descriptive science based on a very elementary sci-
entic methodology. It is indeed not rare to compare
the taxonomists to philatelists rather to researchers pro-
viding scientic insights on biological diversity. The
aim of the symposium is to provide an opportunity toDecember 1, 2017 EvolDir 7
taxonomists to explain their scientic approach to bio-
logical diversity and how this approach is connected to
others elds of evolutionary biology. (1) Methodology
in taxonomy: or why taxonomists are not philatelists?
(2) Taxonomy and systematics in the \omic" era: How
taxonomy and systematics integrate new technical and
methodological advances? (3) Species inventories: facts
or hypotheses about the structure of biodiversity? Im-
pacts on conservation and management issues. (4) How
taxonomy and systematics continue to provide new in-
sights in ^ a euro the origin of species\? (5) What is the
evolutionary signicance of diagnostic characters in the
light of the development of Evo-Devo and Eco-Evo-Devo
research ?

'Adaptation and Phenotypic Plasticity in Marine Species
as a Response to Global Change'
Conference session @ Marine Evolution Conference 2018,
15-17 May 2018, Stromstad, Sweden.
Session abstract:
Anthropogenic activities are causing the global climate
to change at an unprecedented rate. A plethora of
studies have suggested that anomalies in ocean tem-
perature can result in severe drawbacks to the ecology
and behaviour of marine species. Further, an increase
in concentration of atmospheric CO[2] will lead to the
disruption of key processes such as calcication, de-
velopment during larval stages and predator and prey
recognition. Most of these studies, however, do not
take into account the capacity of marine organisms to
acclimate and adapt. Environmental conditions similar
to the ones predicted for the near future occur naturally
in fractions of a species' distribution. Recent studies
have highlighted the genetic mechanism by which these
populations have adapted locally to these exceptional
environments. Further, due to standing genetic varia-
tion within populations, a subset of individuals can be
more resistant to predicted conditions, aiding in their
future persistence. Meanwhile, plastic responses that
organisms may express under various conditions have
been suggested as a mechanism that could enable accli-
mation and can be passed on across generations. This
session will address the interplay of both mechanisms of
genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity and their
role in long-term adaptation of marine organisms to
changing environments. The goal is to assemble cross-
disciplinary studies from a variety of taxa and biological
scales, which is imperative to understand the fate ofDecember 1, 2017 EvolDir 9

EVOLUTION AND EPIGENETICS / NON-GENETIC
INHERITANCE
Conference session @ Marine Evolution 2018, 15-17 May
2018, Stromstad, Sweden
We invite abstracts from researchers who tackle the
epigenetic mechanisms
behind plastic responses and non-genetic inheritance in
marine species
from a theoretical as well as from an experimental ap-
proach.
ABSTRACT: Epigenetic and gene-regulatory processes
represent a potentially important, but little researched
factor in population responses to long-term change,
rapid change, or perturbations. Within the same gener-
ation, epigenetic mechanisms may allow an organism to
create phenotypic variation or to display altered reaction
norms in the absence of genetic variation. Additionally,
the inheritance of non-genetic information such as hor-
mones, nutrients, proteins, RNAs, DNA methylation
patterns, and histone modications from one generation
to the next may allow ospring to cope with unexpected
environments in the absence of genetic change, and thus
may facilitate rapid adaptation processes. Because of
certain experimental and also conceptual challenges,
there is no consensus on the prevalence and on the rele-
vance of epigenetic processes in species adaptation. We
therefore invite abstracts from researchers who tackle
the epigenetic mechanisms behind plastic responses and
non-genetic inheritance in marine species from a theo-retical as well as from an experimental approach. We
ask them to present their approaches and results, and
to discuss principles, concepts and challenges related to
the topic.

lution 2018, 15-17 May 2018, Str omstad, Sweden
We are pleased to announce the call for abstracts for the
symposium: Evolutionary Biology of Marine Invasions
at the Marine Evolution 2018 Conference
Marine invasions represent natural experiments in evo-
lution, as invasive species spread and adapt to novel
environments. In addition, the introduction of novel
species to marine systems can impact the evolution-
ary biology of resident species from the population to
community to ecosystem levels. Often, these evolution-
ary changes can be very rapid and may take myriad
forms, including physiological adaptation and behav-
ioral changes to exploit new environments. Likewise,
resident species may evolve quickly in response to strong
selective forces exerted by invaders, leading to changes
in resident populations, community interactions, and
even their environments. However, the eld of invasion
processes and interactions has remained a \black-box"
for many marine systems. As rates of anthropogenic
transport around the globe increase, so do the spread
and expansion of a multitude of species that would other-
wise be geographically constrained. Discerning sources,
timing, and vectors of invasive species are often main
objectives in marine genetic studies, while elucidating
the adaptive shifts and population dynamics is funda-
mental for biodiversity conservation and management
of stocks. This session aims to advance the understand-
ing of invasion mechanisms, local adaptation processes,10 EvolDir December 1, 2017
and the interactions of introduced species with native
populations and marine environments.

Is this your area of expertise? Or a topic you want to
know more about? The call for abstracts is currently
open.
Metagenomic surveys have documented marked spatial
heterogeneity in the distribution of aquatic microbes,
revealing a previously unknown and spatially dynamic
microbial landscape. Spatial heterogeneity in marine mi-
crobial communities can inuence the genetic diversityand population structure of their hosts, an eect that is
expected to be especially pronounced at immune loci in-
volved in microbial recognition. While high-throughput
sequencing has become a powerful tool for the quantica-
tion of cryptic biodiversity, the overwhelming majority
of marine microbes can still not be readily cultured,
complicating eorts to move beyond association stud-
ies to understand the underlying processes regulating
host-microbe interactions. Our session will bring to-
gether researchers working at the forefront of marine
metagenomics, microbiology, and the experimental anal-
ysis of host-microbe interactions to discuss strategies
for the functional analysis of host-microbe associations
in marine environments, and their implications for un-
derstanding aquatic biodiversity and evolution.
We are currently recruiting presenters and participants.

Dear colleagues,
My co-organizer Martin Thiel and I would like to invite
you to present your research at the symposium \Too few,
too many, or just right: Causes and Consequences of Sex
Ratio Variation", part of the upcoming International
Crustacean Congress IX in Washington DC from May
22-25th 2018. The aim of this symposium is to highlight
the importance of sex ratios for evolutionary and pop-
ulation biology. Participants of this symposium might
present examples of crustacean species or populations
with variable or biased sex ratios, discuss natural and
anthropogenic causes of sex ratio variation, and review
possible eects on mating interactions, sexual selection
and population biology. Scientists at all steps of their
career are encouraged to participate!
If you are interested in participating in this symposium,
please contact Martin Thiel (thiel@ucn.cl) or Christine
Ewers-Saucedo (ewers.christine@gmail.com).

Symposium summary: While conservation biology con-
centrates on population size as a measure of extinction
risk, sex ratio, especially the operational sex ratio, can
also have great impact on a populations' performance.
Diverging sex ratios may reduce the eective number of
breeding individuals and the eective population size,
which can make populations more susceptible to ex-
tinction. Moreover, changes in sex ratios aect the
competition for access to mates, thereby aecting repro-
ductive behavior, sexual selection and mating systems.
While sex ratios vary naturally in some populations,
others are biased by human action. Natural causes
of sex ratio variation include sex-specic survival (e.g.
predation), local mate competition, and feminizing par-
asites. Anthropogenic causes include masculinizing and
feminizing contaminants and sex-biased sheries. Shifts
in climate and temperature (whether along natural gra-
dients or human-caused) can also impact sex ratios. Sex
ratio variation and bias has the potential to play an
important role in many crustacean taxa, which therefore
provide opportunities to compare and contrast causes
and consequences of operational sex ratios using ex-
perimental, observational and comparative approaches.
Participants of this symposium will present examples
of species and populations with variable or biased sex
ratios, discuss natural and anthropogenic causes of sex
ratio variation, and review possible eects on reproduc-
tive biology, mating interactions, sexual selection and
population biology.
We plan to publish a special issue in Invertebrate Re-
production and Development.
We applied for funding to oset some of the meeting
costs for our symposium speakers.
We are looking forward to seeing you in DC, Martin
Thiel and Christine Ewers-Saucedo

BallStateU BehavioralEvolution
Graduate Student Positions in Behavioral Evolution
The Ward Lab at Ball State University is seeking bright
and talented MSc students for Fall 2018. Research in
our lab seeks to understand the proximate and ultimate
factors that control variation in behavior. We work pri-
marily with stream shes, but projects involving other
organisms are possible. Current projects in the lab focus
on two non-mutually exclusive lines of inquiry:
1. Communication systems, sensory perception, and
information processing
How do organisms perceive and respond to one another
and the environment? This line of research focuses on
understanding the mechanisms, function and evolution
of sensory and communication systems. Questions asked
relate to how animals have evolved to perceive, process,
and respond to stimuli in the contexts of mate choice,
aggression, and predator-prey dynamics, as well as how
behavior develops in response to abiotic environmental
cues.
2. Ecological and evolutionary consequences of human-
driven behavioral change on animals
What drives the behavioral responses of organisms to
a changing world? Another focus of our research is to
clarify how dierent forms of human activity (endocrine
disrupting chemicals, land-use changes, invasive intro-
ductions) modify the behavior of organisms, and the
associated ecological and evolutionary implications of
these changes.
Interested prospective students should contact Dr. Jes-
sica Ward at jlward4@bsu.edu. Please include (i) a letter
of motivation including a maximum 1-page statement of
your research interests and relevant technical skills and

*** PhD studentship in Plant Evolutionary Radiations
available from Oct 2018 ***
* Background * Predicting the conditions that allow
species to proliferate in diversity is a central question in
evolutionary biology and has practical implications for
modern conservation. In many parts of the world, recent
and rapid radiations have accompanied the expansion of
habitats due to climatic and geological changes (Hughes
et al. 2015). However, the importance of niche-based
ecological processes in not only generating diversity, but
also inuencing evolutionary dynamics, remains poorly
understood.
This studentship aims to test how dierent types of niche
formation inuence species diversication at micro- and
macro-evolutionary scales. The rst component involves
adapting a widely-used mathematical model of adap-
tive evolution to track genetic and trait responses of
individual plants over thousands of generations in re-
sponse to dierent ecological conditions (Gavrilets and
Vose 2005). This will generate hypotheses, such as
faster rates of niche expansion and contraction promote
species diversity, which we might test experimentally in
the laboratory by evolving a model organism, such as
Pseudomonas uorescens, under dierent environmen-
tal conditions (e.g. Koeppel et al. 2013). The second
part of the project will adopt a synthetic approach to
relate features of dierent biogeographic regions (e.g.
climatic stability) to macro-evolutionary dynamics of
their corresponding oras.
* What the student will do * The student will code
the theoretical model in a programming language and
rene the modelling scenarios that will be tested. They
will also design and execute the laboratory experiment,
measuring phenotypic responses and genetic variationDecember 1, 2017 EvolDir 17
among populations. In the second part of the project,
they will use phylogenetic comparative methods to re-
construct the evolutionary history of plant lineages in
dierent biogeographic regions. Our group has already
identied a number of biogeographic regions and plant
lineages for which this analysis would be tractable. In
the rst instance, the student will estimate phylogenetic
trees for dierent lineages using pre-existing barcode
data on GenBank. Speciation and extinction rates will
then be estimated using established maximum-likelihood
and Bayesian approaches, and associated with regional
characteristics using standard regression techniques, e.g.
PGLS.
* Eligibility and Funding * The studentship will be
awarded as part of a competitive process under the
University of Cambridge's NERC-funded Earth System
Science Doctoral Training Partnership. UK and EEA
students who meet the UK residency requirements will
be eligible for a full studentship that covers the cost
of all fees and provides the standard NERC mainte-
nance allowance (14,553 pa for 2017/18). Students from
EU countries who do not meet the residency require-
ments may still be eligible for a fees-only award, and
can apply for maintenance feeds funded by the various
Cambridge Trusts. Overseas students may similarly
be able to join the programme but will need to have
arranged funding from other sources. Further funding
details are available here: https://essdtp.esc.cam.ac.uk/-
prospective-students/funding-information * How to Ap-
ply * Interested applicants should email AJ Tanentzap
(ajt65 -at- cam.ac.uk) expressing their interest and at-
tach a CV. Individuals with a Masters in evolutionary
biology, phylogenetics, or a related discipline are partic-
ularly encouraged to apply.

Human populations are increasing rapidly and consump-
tion is intensifying. At the same time biodiversity, which
provides critical ecosystem services, is being lost at an
unprecedented rate. Realisation of this crisis has cre-
ated an urgent need to balance agricultural production
with biodiversity. These two objectives are not disjoint,
and indeed, biodiversity can play an integral role in
increasing agricultural yields'Xsustainably. To achieve
balance, we must manage ecosystems for species that
provide support for crops (\ecosystem service species' ^A,
e.g. species that provide pest control) as well as those
that encourage biodiversity ("keystone species\), and
especially those that provide both functions ("cross-over
species\).
To truly work towards this balance, we must rst under-
stand the food web, because species vary greatly in their
value for agriculture and biodiversity services. The stu-
dent will use state-of-the-art genetics methods to deduce
the diets of animals in the food web of plants, birds,
bats and arthropods in African cacao plantations (the
main ingredient of chocolate). He or she will address:
A) Which member species are most inuential in encour-
aging crop yields and/or increasing biodiversity? B) Do
the above insights change depending on the context of
the landscape, e.g. at sites near or far from forest? C)
How can we use the above insights to manage ecosystems
that are both diverse and high-yielding?

Even though the oceans cover the majority of the
Earth' ^As surface, birds have colonized the oceanic realm
only a handful of times during evolutionary history.
Oceanic seabirds are intimately tied to their habitat
and demonstrate many novel morphological and eco-
logical characteristics, from dynamic soaring to pursuit
diving for prey to underwater propulsion in ightless
species. Unfortunately, they are also one of the most
threatened groups of birds in the world. Thus, oceanic
birds provide an excellent system for investigation of
ecological diversication, as well as the factors asso-
ciated with extinction risk. In general the molecular
phylogeny of oceanic seabirds has been well studied,
with the striking exception of the petrels, shearwaters,
and albatrosses of the order Procellariiformes, which is
the largest and most diverse group. For this project,
the student will generate genome-scale mitochondrial
and nuclear DNA sequence data sets to build a time-
calibrated, species-level phylogeny for this order. This
tree will be combined with information about their eco-
logical, morphological, and life history characteristics,
to investigate the evolution of ecological traits as well as
the factors associated with extinction risk in this unique
and highly threatened group. Large-scale analyses such
as these will provide a framework for studying the evo-
lutionary ecology and conservation biology of a broad
and globally important ecological role, that of oceanic
avian predators.

jectives: To test hypotheses about the more specic
mechanisms that generate distinct patterns of diver-
sity at functional loci across environmental gradients
in the marine environment using high resolution next
generation sequencing data and working with reference
genomes. The key objectives will be to identify loci or
gene systems that reect diversity requiring conservation
management that are not detectable using conventional
methods based on neutral loci. At the same time, these
data will enhance our understanding of the process of
adaptive evolution, providing novel inference about the
evolution of diversity in the marine ecosystem.
A more detailed yer about the project is available on re-
quest. All nationalities are eligible for this studentship.
Project 2: Phylogeography of European ungulates from
the last interglacial period and their subsequent evo-
lution Objectives: This study will use next generation
sequencing methods to explore the genetic diversity of
deer and other ungulates from the Eemian interglacial
period, ~120,000 years ago. This will allow us to test
hypotheses about the origin and evolution of modern
populations, the impact of the last glacial period on
the diversity and distribution of these species, and the
phylogenetic relationship between ancient and modern
populations, and between each and the rest of the cervid
lineage. A key aspect of the study will be the integration
of environmental data, so that any changes in demogra-
phy or distribution can be interpreted in the context of
changing environments.

The CRUSTOMICS lab at Florida International Uni-
versity in the Department of Biology and Marine Sci-
ences Program is looking for highly motivated graduate
students with an interest in evolutionary biology and
marine invertebrates.
Research Interests
The Bracken-Grissom Lab is fundamentally interested
in the evolution of marine invertebrates. Many projects
investigate the Decapod Tree of Life and use a phy-
logenetic framework to study various aspects of their
diversication, ecology, biogeography, and conservation.
More recent projects integrate taxonomic and genomic
methods to study evolutionary processes and complex
traits in extreme environments including the deep sea,
aquatic caves, and habitats exposed to anthropogenic
disasters. Current awarded grants target the evolution
of bioluminescence in the deep sea, molecular conver-
gence of cave-adapted phenotypes and ecosystem health
following the Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Horizon Oil
Spill. More information on our research can be found
here: *www.brackengrissomlab.com Qualications
Applicants should have a background in evolutionary
biology and molecular methods. Experience with inver-
tebrate zoology, phylogenetics, systematics, next genera-
tion sequencing methods and/or bioinformatics is a plus.
Students would ideally have a B.S. degree in Biology or
related discipline. Student must be procient in English
(both spoken and written). Our work requires good
organizational and computational skills and the ability
to work collaboratively as part of a team. Occasional
physically demanding eldwork may also be required to
support research.
Requirements
The Bracken-Grissom lab is looking for 1 graduate stu-
dent to start in the Fall of 2018. PhD candidates are
preferred but students interested in pursuing an MS
degree are welcome to apply. If you are interestedin applying for a graduate position in my lab, please

AvianAdaptation
The current speed at which environmental conditions
change is unprecedented, endangering vulnerable popu-
lations and species. A novel idea for how organisms can
sustainably respond to rapid environmental changes are
environmentally induced adaptations that are heritable.
Such trans-generational, potentially epigenetic eects
can, with high precision mediate evolutionary rescue
of populations that experience rapidly changing envi-
ronments. These advantages put TAGs at the forefront
of mechanisms leading to adaptations to global change.
This project will use long-term data from a wild popula-
tion of passerines, and focused experiments on birds in
captivity, to disentangle phenotypic plasticity induced
during development from epigenetic TAGs, to better
understand the epigenetic mechanism, and evolution of
TAGs. We will use state-of-the art long-RNA sequenc-
ing experiments to pinpoint TAGs in RNA methylation
patterns in sparrow sperm, using focused experiments
in captive and/or wild birds.
This exciting project will push further the limits of
our knowledge on trans-generational eect. It will be
conducted in collaboration between Imperial College,
the Sanger Institute, the Gurdon Institute University
Cambridge, and the University of Sheeld.
Students should be interested in molecular biology, be
willing and able to handle birds, and be interested in
quantitative data analysis. A BTO ringing license is
benecial.

Matthew Fisher (Imperial College London, Infectious
Disease Epidemiology), Richard Everitt (University
of Reading, Mathematics and Statistics) PROJECT
SUMMARY: The amphibian chytrid fungus Batra-
chochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is responsible for hun-
dreds of species' extinctions. The genetic mechanisms
that underpin Bd's virulence are not known yet, al-
though extreme chromosomal plasticity has been sug-
gested to play a role. Large-scale genomic data from
worldwide isolates, coupled with appropriate compu-
tational methods, will provide us with an opportunity
to address how virulent Bd strains spread around the
globe.
This project will encompass three main aims: (i) the
improvement of computational methods for large-scale
high-throughput sequencing data from mixed-ploidy
genome, (ii) the development of a comprehensive bioin-
formatics platform, (iii) the extension of the methods
developed in previous aims to genomic data of Bd iso-
lates distributed worldwide.
HOW TO APPLY: This project is suitable for students
with either a quantitative or empirical background. Ap-
plicants should be meet the UK NERC eligibility criteria
(preferably).

Building on our decade-long evolutionary research on
Lord Howe Island (LHI), the student will use this emerg-
ing model system to disentangle the genomic under-
pinning of speciation, with relevance to understanding
stress tolerance in plants. Uniquely, we have identied a
pair of closely related palm species that have evolved on
the minute LHI by adapting to dierent soil types. One
of the species, Howea forsteriana, evolved on calcareous
soils deposited by the sea one million years ago, which
cause water, salt and metal stresses whilst aecting
owering time. The student will look at the underly-
ing functional genetics of the species split. S/he will
use comparative genomics, large controlled environment
assays, transformations, and eld experiments to vali-
date candidate genes for speciation, stress tolerance and
owering time.
We expect the student to learn advanced quantita-
tive, molecular biology and eldwork skills, and publish
his/her work in high-impact journals. The project is su-
pervised by Professor Vincent Savolainen and Dr Colin

our laboratory at Indiana State University (ISU). These
graduate positions are part of a new interdisciplinary
initiative at ISU, The Center for Genomic Advocacy
(TCGA), which is focused on the application of genomic
technology to the betterment of society. TCGA is de-
veloping a state-of-the-art next generation sequencing
facility, which is being used to provide hands-on expe-
rience for students as well as string infrastructure for
modern genomic studies.
Graduate research will be expected to combine tradi-
tional behavioral ecology studies with next-generation
sequencing technology to examine the evolution of poly-
morphism in the white-throated sparrow. Student will
conduct extensive laboratory work as well as participate
in eld based data collection during the breeding season.
This species exhibits a clear link between phenotype and
genotype, making it an ideal system in which to pin-
point the determinants of complex sexual and parental
behavior. We have amassed 29 years of detailed data
on this species making it possible to identify the ge-
netic, epigenetic, and environmental bases of behavior.
Morphs of the white-throated sparrow provide a unique
opportunity to study intraspecic genomic dierences,which have resulted from two separate, yet linked evo-
lutionary trajectories. Such results can transform our
understanding of the evolution of genomes.
To apply, please send a letter of intent and curriculum

SalmonConservation
Project Description Aquaculture is fast outpacing the
production of wild sheries and there is increasing con-
cern regarding the potential negative impacts of farm
escapes on wild populations of conspecics. Scotland
has the second largest Atlantic salmon farming indus-
try in the species' native North Atlantic range, after
Norway. In 2015, this encompassed a production of
>40 million smolts and >171,000 tonnes of salmon for
market, with increased production planned for coming
years. Scotland also has hundreds of rivers with wild
salmon stocks that are the mainstay of a vital recre-
ational shing industry that is a major contributor to
the nation's economic wealth.
The project involves the exploitation of diagnostic molec-
ular markers developed by the RLI as part of a UK Re-
search Council aquaculture sector funded international
research collaboration with partners in Norway, Scot-
land, Ireland and Canada to dierentiate farm and wild
Atlantic salmon. These will be used to assess actual
levels of escaped farm salmon in rivers across Scotland,
of interbreeding, and of genetic introgression. The lack26 EvolDir December 1, 2017
of understanding of these factors precludes the eec-
tive management of the species, risking unacceptable
impacts on wild stocks or holding back expansion of
the farming industry, or potentially both. In Norway,
genetic mixing is highly variable, from 0-47% while in
Scotland only a few, ad hoc studies have been carried
out on levels of direct genetic interaction and most of
these are dated and provide insight into only a few
rivers with general, contemporary levels being poorly
documented.
Knowledge of the level of interbreeding and introgression
can help guide locational development of the farming
industry to minimize impacts on wild stocks and sh-
eries. Where it can be demonstrated to be limited or
absent, this will also help to gain Marine Stewardship
certication for farmed salmon products. The project
will involve collaboration with local sheries manage-
ment organisations to collect contemporary samples of
salmon in a representative set of Scottish rivers and to
genetically screen these sh, along with archived his-
torical samples, with the farm-wild markers. Levels
of escapement, interbreeding and introgression will be
quantied, mapped and the factors accounting for ob-
served levels investigated. The implications of observed
levels will be explored using an existing individual based
genetic-demographic reproductive interaction model.
Supervisory Team The student will be supervised by
Dr Mark Coulson and Professor Eric Verspoor of the
Rivers and Lochs Institute.
Research Facilities and Environment The student will be
based in the Rivers and Loch Institute at the University
of the Highlands and Islands Inverness College on the
new Inverness Campus and part of a small but grow-
ing, dynamic team of researchers focused on aquatic
biodiversity conservation and management. The RLI
is recognized internationally for its expertise in genetic
issues related to aquaculture-wild interactions and as
well as in the development of molecular genetic markers,
applied molecular population genetics, sheries man-
agement, and sh phylogeography. It is also extend-
ing its programme of work to encompass eDNA, DNA
barcoding, and metabarcoding, across the spectrum of
aquatic organisms, with a focus on freshwater ecosys-
tems. The Institute provides a stimulating and vibrant
research environment, supported by a state-of-the-art
molecular genomics facility encompassing Sanger and
NexGen sequencing systems, qPCR, high throughput
DNA fragment analysis instrumentation, with technical
support, and in-house bioinformatics, computing and
statistical support. The student will receive training in
manuscript writing and research presentation as well as
engage in-house seminars in research skill development
and contribute to weekly alternating journal club andwork presentation meetings. There will also be oppor-
tunities to attend relevant national and international
conferences.

The project:
Epidemic dynamics of ancient disease outbreaks
Many of the major human infectious diseases likely arose
after the origins of agriculture. Much of what we know
about ancient disease outbreaks in the past has been
written down by chroniclers who were present during
the time and have often suered from the disease them-
selves. There are concerns that these writings may be
exaggerated, incomplete or inconsistent. Thanks to the
recent advances in ancient genome recovery, we are now
in the position to shed light on the dynamics of past
disease epidemics by deciphering the 'footprint' that
past disease outbreaks left on the pathogens' genomes.
Understanding the origins and demographic dynamics
of ancient pathogens may facilitate a broader under-
standing of disease emergence.
Your tasks:
- Phylogenetic analysis of ancient pathogen genomes in
close collaboration with the Department of Archaeoge-
netics (DAG), led by Professor Dr. Johannes Krause. -
Revision and adaptation of methods used for estimation
of divergence times and evolutionary substitution rates
of ancient pathogens. - Bayesian (if suitable) phylo-
dynamic analysis of ancient disease outbreaks, based
on whole genome sequences from the DAG. Develop-
ment of statistical tools for inference of epidemiological
parameters from ancient disease outbreaks.
Your qualications:
- PhD position: o Master or equivalent in a quantitative
discipline such as Computational Biology, Mathematics,
Statistics, Computer Science, Physics.
- Postdoc position: o Have or are about to obtain a PhD
degree in a quantitative discipline such as Computa-

LanguageEvolution
The Transmission, Infection, Diversication & Evolu-
tion Group (TIDE) led by Denise K uhnert is oering
one PhD and one Postdoctoral position to begin on
01.06.2018.
The project:
The \phylodynamics" of language evolution
There is evidence of infectious diseases having had ma-
jor eects on the course of history, mostly by directly
diminishing population sizes or by causing people to ee
from disease. For example, the expansion of Austrone-
sian languages into Remote Oceania has been theorized
to have been pushed by one of the plasmodia causing
malaria infection. Testing such theories requires both,
an understanding of the past pathogen dynamics and
the cultural and linguistic evolution. The eld of phy-
lolinguistics has so far mainly been using methods that
were developed for viruses or other pathogens.
The initial aim of this project is to develop, test and
employ mathematical concepts to describe the tree-December 1, 2017 EvolDir 31
generating processes appropriate for language evolution.
They will be based on birth-death processes, which are
suitable to model language evolution as they can incor-
porate periods of constant growth or decline, stagnation,
but also bursts and extinction events.
This project will be performed in close collaboration
with the Department of Linguistic and Cultural Evolu-
tion, led by Professor Dr. Russell Gray.
Your tasks:
- Development of birth-death process based methods for
the reconstruction of language phylogenies in a Bayesian
framework. - Analysis of language families, such as the
Austronesian and Austroasiatic language families, to
test hypotheses about their origins and historic develop-
ment. - Test dependence of language diversication on
demographic dynamics and potential links to ancient
infectious disease outbreaks.

discipline such as Computational Biology, Mathematics,
Statistics, Computer Science, Physics.
- Postdoc position: o Have or are about to obtain a
PhD degree in a quantitative discipline such as Com-

PhD Positions in Evolutionary Developmental Genomics
at Michigan State University
The Fish Evo Devo Geno Lab (PI Ingo Braasch) at
Michigan State University is recruiting highly motivated
PhD students interested in working on the genomic basis
of vertebrate evolution and development to start in Fall
2018.
The Braasch Lab focuses on genomic and developmental
changes that contribute to major transitions during the
course of vertebrate evolution and studies evolutionary
novelties at the levels of genome structure, gene family
evolution, and gene regulation. We combine compara-
tive genomics with analyses of molecular evolution and
functional genetic and developmental approaches using
a variety of shes as our model systems (spotted gar,
zebrash, medaka and others).
Possible projects fall within the following broader re-
search areas of the group:
1. Genomic and morphological evolution of shes: How
do changes in gene regulation contribute to evolutionary
novelties and key innovations? How do morphological
dierences among sh lineages arise from diversica-
tion of gene repertoires? What is the role of gen(om)e
duplications and gene losses in generating phenotypic
diversity?
2. Conquest of land and 'sh-out-of-water': We are
studying genomic changes and their functional conse-
quences leading to the evolution of tetrapods from shes
and other 'sh-out-of-water' scenarios, including the evo-
lutionary loss of genes at the water-to-land transition
and the gene regulatory basis of hatching.
3. Evolutionary analyses of biomedical sh genomes:
Combining genomic sequence comparisons, gene expres-
sion analyses and epigenomic proling, we aim to im-
prove connectivity of teleost biomedical sh models
such as zebrash and medaka to human biology and
disease. This work is support by the NIH (http://-
bit.ly/2o8R8c1). For additional information on our
research, see also Braasch et al. 2016, Nature Genetics
(doi:10.1038/ng.3526) and Braasch et al. 2015, JEZB
(doi:10.1002/jez.b.22589).
Our group is part of the Department of Integrative Biol-
ogy (IBIO; https://integrativebiology.natsci.msu.edu/),the Ecology, Evolutionary, and Behavior Pro-
gram (EEBB; https://eebb.natsci.msu.edu/),
and the Genetics Graduate Program (https://-
genetics.natsci.msu.edu/) at Michigan State.
MSU IBIO has a strong research commitment to ver-
tebrate biology with a highly collaborative community
of groups working on sh evolution, genomics, devel-
opment, population genetics, neuroscience, behavior,
ecology, and conservation, allowing for vibrant exchange
among elds, methods and model systems.
Qualications: Applicants should hold a bachelor's de-
gree in biology, genetics, molecular biology, bioinfor-
matics, zoology or related elds. Suitable candidates
should be enthusiastic about sh biology and excited
about working in an interdisciplinary manner. Previous
research experience in a relevant area is desired.
Admission: Students will be admitted through
the MSU IBIO Graduate Program (https://-
integrativebiology.natsci.msu.edu/graduate-program/)
and the MSU Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, and Be-
havior Group (https://eebb.natsci.msu.edu/). Another
possible route of admission is through the MSU Genetics
Graduate Program within the MSU BioMolecular
Science Gateway (https://biomolecular.natsci.msu.edu/-
applicants/how-to-apply/).
Application deadlines for both the MSU IBIO and Ge-
netics Graduate Programs are December 1, 2017.
Funding: Financial support is provided through research
and teaching assistantships and the PI's external fund-
ing. Competitive applicants will be eligible for university
fellowships and supported in applying for graduate fel-
lowships from NSF, NIH, and other agencies.
Interested candidates should email Ingo Braasch

Two fully-funded PhD position are available to work in
the Hall group (see mattdhall.com) on themes broadly
related to evolutionary ecology, health, and tness. Us-
ing species of Daphnia and their associated pathogens
as a powerful experimental model, the successful candi-
dates will work closely with Matt and his collaborators
to develop projects that explore any one of the following
eco-evolutionary processes.
1) Sexual antagonism and the evolution of health and t-
ness. Exploring how conict between the sexes arise and
inuence dierent aspects of an organism's health. Can
blend together both theory and empirical approaches
to exploring genetic architecture as interests dictate
(together with Tim Connallon at Monash, http://-
timconnallon.com/).
2) Energy ux and the spread of disease. The rate at
which organisms use, transform, and expend energy de-
nes not only an organism's \pace of life", but also how
readily that can be exploited by a pathogen. Advances in
high-throughput metabolic assays oer opportunities to
incorporate energy ux into studies of host-pathogen co-
evolution (together with Dustin Marshall and the Centre
for Geometric Biology at Monash, https://cgb.org.au/
).
3) Demography and host-pathogen interactions. Pop-
ulations are rarely stable and dierent densities or
growth trajectories can feed back into the spread of
disease within and between patches. Experimental meso-
cosms oer opportunities to explore infectious disease in
light of dierent demographic dynamics (Together with
Ben Phillips at the University of Melbourne, https://-
blphillipsresearch.wordpress.com/).
A stipend (living-allowance) scholarship of ~ $26,288 per
annum is provided tax free (the equivalent of approx.
$33,000 before tax) with no teaching requirements for
3.5 years (the length of a PhD in Australia). We also
oer travel and establishment allowances to help in your
move and our tuition scholarships cover the cost of
tuition fees (normally $38,900 per year). Guaranteed
funding of project costs and research support, including
the costs of attending at least one conference per year,
is included.
Project start dates can be any time in rst half of 2018
onwards.To be eligible, applicants must have completed a 4 year
degree with a research component or have post-graduate
research experience in ecology, genetics, behaviour, or
evolution (or will do so by the end of the year). Pref-
erence will be given to those with strong quantitative
skills and publications in international journals. Inter-

Kingdom / South AfricaDecember 1, 2017 EvolDir 35
Overview
Lying within south-western corner of Africa, the Suc-
culent Karoo biome is recognised as one of the World's
most important regions of plant diversity [1]. Here mem-
bers of the plant family Aizoaceae are especially well
adapted to the arid desert environment. This is most
evident in the speciose genus Conophytum, a Succulent
Karoo specialist consisting of dwarf succulent plants
that show a remarkable degree of range-restricted en-
demism [2]. The Succulent Karoo has been identied
as being at high risk from the eects of climate change,
with preliminary data suggesting that dwarf succulents
may be especially vulnerable [3]. However, we still don't
know the underlying mechanisms that inuence the
distribution and associated speciation of these species.
The aim of this project is to better understand the key
drivers of the remarkable radiation within Conophytum.
Early molecular phylogenetic analyses of the Aizoaceae
family suggested that it represents one of the fastest
and largest radiation of any plant group [4]. Within the
diverse tribe Ruschieae (71 genera) the Conophytum-
clade consists of ten closely-related genera. Intriguingly,
oral traits in the genus Conophytum are unusually
diverse with variations in ower coloration [5], phenol-
ogy (seasonality of owering), and in anthesis (timing
of owering). No other member of Aizoaceae displays
such diversity. Presence of nocturnal owers extremely
rare within Aizoaceae but account for the quarter of
Conophytum taxa and preliminary work showed that
this complex trait evolved multiple times [6].
Conophytum is also characterized by having the vast
majority of species ower in the austral autumn, in
contrast to when majority of plants ower (the austral
winter and spring) within the winter-rainfall region of
southwestern Africa. Seasonal shifts in owering is rare
within Conophytum. However, recently the existence of
several pairs of morphologically similar species that dis-
play dierences in phenology has been reported [7], with
each species within a pair having a highly restricted dis-
tribution (point-endemics). This diversity of owering
time found within a group of closely related species gives
us a unique opportunity to elucidate genetic controls
in charge of activation of owering within non-model
organisms.
Flowering time is an important trait in plants that
aects both their life cycles as well as those of pollina-
tor species. Apart from fundamental interest in how
this trait evolved, better understanding of it is crucial
for both increasing the global crop yield as well as for
mitigating the eects of climate change. Despite the im-
portant role of owering time, its underlying pathways
are understudied.The PhD candidate will test if shifts in both the sea-
sonality and timing of owering have been among the
major drivers in the ecologically important and highly
successful radiation of the genus Conophytum resulting
in rapid speciation of 150+ taxa and permitting range
expansion. S(he) will decode structure and evolution
of transcriptional regulatory network which regulates
owering time in Conophytum using a tool-box of mod-
ern genetics. In doing so we will be better equipped for
the development of conservation measures that reduce
the extinction risk of these vulnerable taxa and preserve
their adaptive potential and functional diversity.

Project With the emergence of ancient DNA techniques
combined with high-throughput sequencing (paleoge-

natural history collections have emerged. Cinchona
bark, the source of quinine for treatment of malaria,
is an outstanding time referenced model system. We
will use both modern samples across their geographi-
cal range, as well as unrivalled historical collections of
about 1000 specimens documenting 150 years of collect-
ing and breeding experiments including samples from
forests that no longer exist as well as the chemically
annotated collections of Howard and Sons. However,
botanical and geographical origin of the historical sam-
ples was poorly recorded preventing us from utilizing
these extensive collections until now. This project will
generate paleogenomic data from historic Cinchona bark
samples, use high-throughput sequencing to resolve the
current phylogeny of the tribe Cinchoneae based on
in-house modern geographically annotated samples to
produce a framework allowing placing of the historical
samples to species and geographical area, providing crit-
ical links for determining changes in the distribution
of Cinchona forest over 200 years, including hundreds
of chemically annotated historical samples of Howards

EvolutionSeasonalTiming
PhD position on \Evolutionary responses in seasonal
timing to a warming world" at the Netherlands Institute
of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW) and GELIFES at Univeristy
of Groningen
Project information Seasonal timing of reproduction
and growth has major tness consequences. Due to
climate change, species are advancing their timing but
species within a food chain do not advance at the same
rate. This may lead to directional selection on seasonal
timing. A better understanding of the genetic variation
and selection pressures underlying seasonal timing is
essential for predicting the rate at which species adapt
to their warming world. The research will be carried
out on great tits, part of the well studied food chain of
oak, winter moth and great tit.
This PhD project will have three main aspects: (1) mea-
suring selection on seasonal timing during breeding time,38 EvolDir December 1, 2017
(2) measuring selective pressures during the pre-breeding
period, and (3) exploring the eect of dispersal on local
evolutionary change. Studying selection during breeding
time (1) will make use of already existing selection lines
for early and late reproduction in great tits. Ospring of
these lines will be introduced in the wild to obtain unbi-
ased tness measurements of early and late reproducing
birds. Selection pressures during the pre-laying period
(2) will be studied by quantifying the phenology of food
availability during egg laying directly and using satellite
data to extrapolate the current data set on this food
availability to a longer set of years. Whether individuals
dispersing into the study area aect genetic variation
and adaptation because they were dierently selected
than the local birds (3) will be studied by analysing us-
ing our long-term data base (1955-present). Combined
with other research questions that will be developed by
the PhD student, this project should give better insight
in the rate and ability at which species can adapt to a
warming world.
The Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW)
has an excellent track record on evolutionary ecology,
with ample experience with working with birds in the
wild, under controlled conditions and with their genomes.
The Chronobiology unit of GELIFES (University of
Groningen) has an excellent track record on chronobiol-
ogy, including seasonal timing. The position is super-
vised by Prof Dr Marcel E. Visser at the Netherlands
Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW) in Wageningen
(m.visser@nioo.knaw.nl or +31 317473439) and by Prof
Dr Roelof A. Hut (r.a.hut@rug.nl) of the Chronobiology
unit of the Groningen Institute for Evolutionary Life
Sciences (GELIFES), University of Groningen.
Qualications - you should have an MSc or equivalent
in Biology or a related discipline, preferably with a
strong background in Evolutionary Ecology, Ecological
Genetics or Evolutionary Physiology - you are expected
to have an excellent academic record (list of examina-
tion marks from your university study) and be curious,
creative and ambitious - you should be able to write
scientic articles and reports (to be proven by your
graduation thesis or another comparable report) and be
uent in English both in writing and speech.
Conditions of employment The University of Gronin-
gen oers an appointment for a period of four years,
which should be concluded during this period with a
PhD examination. The University of Groningen oers
a salary of ^A 2,222 gross per month in the rst year
up to a maximum of ^A 2,840 gross per month in the
fourth and nal year, based on a full-time position (1.0
FTE), excluding a 8% holiday allowance and a 8.3%
end-of-the-year bonus. The rst year constitutes a pro-
bationary period, with an evaluation of the candidate'sperformance after 9 months. The objective of this eval-
uation is to establish whether the candidate will be able
to nish a PhD thesis in the remaining three years. If
the performance evaluation is positive, the candidate's
contract will be extended by another 3 years, for a total
of 4 years.
The PhD student will be appointed at the University
of Groningen but the research will be carried out at
the Animal Ecology Department of the Netherlands
Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW) in Wageningen
(see www.nioo.knaw.nl) in close collaboration with the
Chronobiology unit at the University of Groningen.
A training programme within the Graduate School of

NTNU Taiwan AposematicInsects
The Systematics & Evolutionary Biology Lab in the Na-
tional Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) is recruiting
a self-motivated and enthusiastic PhD student to study
aposematism in insects begin in the Summer of 2018.
*Pachyrhynchus* weevils are a group of brilliant,
metallic-coloured weevils distributed in the Old World
tropics. Recent studies showed that the conspicuous
colouration of these weevils function as eective warning
signals to prevent predacious pursuit by lizards. We are
interested in studying the spatio-temporal dynamics of
interactions between vertebrate predators and apose-
matic prey. The PhD student will be encouraged to,
but not limited to, evaluate the speciation mechanisms
of *Pachyrhynchus*'s aposematism. The students will
be expected to develop their own research dissertation
projects within the scope of these research projects.

***Ph.D. position at Oklahoma State University***
I am recruiting a student to pursue a Ph.D. in my lab
at Oklahoma State University, starting Fall 2018. This
position will be partly supported as a graduate research
assistantship (GRA), for which the student will study
the evolution of morphology and functional performance
in frogs and toads. The GRA involves both laboratory
experiments and eldwork, which will be mostly local
but may involve international trips.
Research in the lab addresses macroevolution and evolu-
tionary biomechanics. Most projects involve eldwork,
laboratory experiments, work with museum specimens,
and phylogenetic comparative analyses. Please see my
lab's website for more information: moenlab.okstate.edu
Students in the lab have the opportunity to work on
ongoing projects, develop their own project, or a combi-
nation of the two. Some (broad) potential dissertation
research topics include: - The mechanics of movement
in frogs and the consequences for macroevolutionary
patterns of morphological diversity - The eects of mod-
ularity and integration on macroevolutionary patterns of
diversity in clades - The importance of deep evolutionary
history on phenotypic evolution
If interested, please send me an introductory email that
includes your research interests (including why you are
specically interested in working on the above topics),
research experience, CV, GPA, and GRE scores. Strong
candidates will have had at least one substantial inde-
pendent research experience, such as a summer REU, un-
dergraduate research thesis, or a Master's degree. Ideal
candidates will have experience in typical lab projects
and methods, including studies of performance and mor-
phology, herpetology, phylogenetic comparative biology,
and statistical analyses in R.
Completed applications need to be submitted to OSU
by 1 February 2018 to receive full consideration, but if
interested you should begin discussing an application
with me long before this date.

mine how natural selection at candidate loci depends
on hermaphrodite germline developmental evolution.
Candidates are expected to have a master's degree in
evolutionary biology and an understanding of the fun-
damental problems of quantitative genetics, population
genetics and developmental genetics, including QTL
and GWAS mapping. Candidates with experience in
computer programming, experimental evolution, devel-
opmental phenotyping and statistical analysis of large
data sets are preferred. The PhD students will be ex-
pected to conduct full-time independent research in both
the Teotonio and Braendle labs.
The PhD positions are funded by the National Agency
of French Research (ANR) for three years, subject to

MicrobeCoevolution
*** PhD position available***
*The genomic basis of host-symbiont dependency*
*Background *
Organisms across the tree of life form partnerships with
microbes for protection, metabolic and nutrition. In
some cases, host and symbiont become so tightly asso-
ciated that dependency evolves and the two organisms
integrate both physically and genomically. Dependency
on microbes is particularly prevalent among insects and
has led them to great success by allowing them to use
otherwise unavailable resources and invade inaccessible
habitats. Here we explore how dependency on microbes
evolves, and how genomes combine to produce the novel
functions that have allowed insects to dominate so many
habitats.
In this project you will use the symbionts of ants and
aphids to rigorously test hypotheses on the evolution of
symbiotic dependency. This may include: exploring the
early stages of genome integration in hosts that have
recently evolved dependency on microbes; reveal how
genomes combine to produce novel adaptive functions;
and determining how host ecology inuences gains and
losses of symbionts.
- You will have access to large genetic databases, insect
collections, in-house live organisms and cutting-edge
research facilitates to fuel your investigation.
- You will gain experience of molecular/experimental bi-
ology, comparative/metagenomics, bioinformatics, and
statistics (e.g. comparative phylogenetics).
- You will be encouraged to develop your own ideas and
hypotheses.
*Skills preferred* In a multidisciplinary project such
as this, candidates are unlikely to have a background
in all disciplines involved. The most important qual-
ication is motivation and that the project appeals
to you. We can envisage strong candidates coming
through various routes including: - evolutionary ge-
nomics/bioinformatics - practical molecular biology -
evolutionary theory

TelAvivU EvolutionaryBiology
PhD position in Evolutionary Biology: \The Evolu-
tion of Virulence under Conditions of Frequent Multiple
Infections"
The position is available from February 1, 2018.
Project Description Interactions between multiple par-
asite species (infecting the same host) can aect the
evolutionary trajectory of virulence, with important
ecological and epidemiological consequences. The goal
of the proposed work is to elucidate implications of
multiple infections on the evolution of (parasite) viru-
lence. The successful candidate will use a combination
of experimental evolution and eld approaches to gen-
erate new and rened predictions regarding the viru-
lence of parasites that spread into new habitats, where
they encounter co-infecting parasites. He/she will use a
model system consisting of the crustacean Daphnia and
their microparasites. The proposed research is a col-
laboration between Israeli and German scientic teams:
Dr. Frida Ben-Ami from Tel Aviv University (http:/-
/fridaslab.weebly.com/) and Prof. Justyna Wolinska
from IGB and Freie Universit at Berlin (http://www.igb-
berlin.de/en/prole/justyna-wolinska), nanced by the
German Science Foundation (DFG). The position is

TuftsU AdaptationSpeciation
The Dopman lab at Tufts University is seeking to recruit
Ph.D. students interested in evolutionary genetics. The
long-range goal of our work is to understand the evolu-
tion of reproductive isolation and ecological adaptation.
Projects on reproductive isolation are using hybridizing
populations of moths to understand the genetic basisDecember 1, 2017 EvolDir 49
of behavioral and allochronic isolation, and the role of
pleiotropy and chromosomal rearrangements for specia-
tion. Current work on adaptation focuses on seasonal
rhythms in moths and butteries, and is addressing the
genetic repeatability of phenology, its inuence on tness
and population persistence, and connecting phenology
change with spatiotemporal gradients in climate.
Students must have the ability to work with others and
a sense of humor, both of which are needed to make sci-
ence fun and worthwhile. An undergraduate background
in molecular genetics, genomics, evolution, or ecology
is preferred, as is prior research experience. Highly
relevant experience includes application of molecular
genetic techniques or computational analysis of genome
data.
The Dopman Lab is in the Department of Biology
(http://ase.tufts.edu/biology/) and is a member of Tufts'
Collaborative Cluster in Genome Structure and Devel-
opmental Patterning. The Cluster focuses on genome to
organism research and is located on the main campus
in Medford, MA. With two additional Tufts campuses
(Boston and Grafton), other research universities (Har-
vard, MIT, BU), and the vibrant city of Boston all
within reach, Medford and Tufts are ideal places to live
and work.

'Plus One' MS opportunities in Ecology and Evolution-
ary Biology at Tulane University.
The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
in the School of Science and Engineering at Tulane Uni-
versity encourages applications to our 'Plus One' MS
program, a one-year, non-thesis MS program.
The Plus One degree program is designed for students
who are interested in seeking employment with environ-
mental agencies of federal, state, and municipal govern-
ment; non-governmental organizations; and in private
industry, including environmental consulting rms. The
program also will be useful for students planning to enter
more advanced professional degree programs (e.g., law,
public health, medicine, veterinary medicine, natural
resources management) and for students intent on pur-
suing additional academic training (e.g., Ph.D. degree
programs). Finally, the program is useful for students
seeking to strengthen teaching skills and pedagogy for
a future career in education.
Students elect to pursue one of three tracks in the pro-
gram:
(1) Research, in which students work closely with a
tenured or tenure-track faculty mentor, with the goal of
strengthening research capacity and potentially produc-
ing a peer-reviewed publication; these students typically
use this track as a stepping stone to a Ph.D. program
in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology or a related eld.
(2) Pedagogy, in which students work closely with one or
more teaching faculty mentors, with the goal of strength-
ening teaching experience and skills, including the option
to serve as an Teaching Fellow in EBIO 1010, Diver-
sity of Life; these students typically go on to teach at
the high school or elementary school level or otherwise
engage in educational activities.
(3) Knowledge base, in which students work with the
Graduate Studies coordinator or other faculty member
to identify courses required to bolster transcripts and
knowledge base; these students typically go on to apply
to professional degree programs such as law, medical,
or veterinary schools or join the workforce.
We have established a strong track record of assisting
Plus One students to meet their professional and ed-
ucational goals. Recent graduates from the program50 EvolDir December 1, 2017
are currently in highly regarded PhD programs, law
schools, medical schools and vet schools; teaching in
high schools; and working in industry and governmental
and non-governmental agencies.
Our department houses a strong team of outstanding
researchers and educators, with established strengths
in coastal and tropical systems. We are committed to
promoting diversity in STEM, and particularly welcome
applications from members of groups that are tradi-
tionally under-represented in the eld of Ecology &
Evolutionary Biology.

Ph.D. opportunities in the Karubian Lab
The Karubian Lab (http://karubian.tulane.edu) is seek-
ing applications to begin Ph.D. studies in Fall 2018.
The Karubian lab is based at the Department of Ecol-
ogy and Evolutionary Biology at Tulane University, in
New Orleans LA. We have an accomplished group of
students, and take pride in the supportive and diverse
environment our lab and department provide. Students
receive TA-ships that cover stipend and tuition costs
during their time at Tulane, and several students have
received competitive National Science Foundation Grad-
uate Research Fellowships and other sources of external
support.
The Karubian lab has a strong commitment to linking
research to real world conservation outcomes via mean-
ingful engagement with local communities in the areas
where we work. Both these projects have important
links to contemporary social issues, and incoming stu-
dents are encouraged to participate in and contribute
to these eorts. Please see http://karubian.tulane.edu/-engagement/overview/ for more information.
The Karubian lab is committed to increasing diversity in
STEM. Students from Latin America and other groups
that are traditionally under-represented in ecology and
evolution are particularly encouraged to apply.
Prospective applicants should contact Dr. Jordan Karu-
bian (jk@tulane.edu) with a statement of interest and
CV.
We are currently recruiting two students, one for each
of following projects:
(1) Evolutionary ecology and conservation of South
American palms.
The over-arching goal of this project is to better under-
stand the forces that regulate distributions and diversity
of palms. This student will develop independent research
that combines eldwork on ecological processes in tropi-
cal rainforest (e.g., dispersal, competition, survival) with
laboratory-based genetic approaches (e.g., population
genetics / genomics, transcriptomics). Students will
build upon previous and ongoing NSF-funded work that
links behavior of dispersal agents to seed and pollen
movement; characterizes ecological and genetic drivers
of non-random seedling survival; and documents how
naturally occurring environmental variation interacts
with human activities to shape patterns of diversity.
Please see http://karubian.tulane.edu/research/plant-
animal-interactions/ for more information.
(2) Behavioral ecology and eects of lead exposure on
Mockingbirds
This student will develop independent research in New
Orleans to investigate how exposure to lead, a common
contaminant in urban environments, impacts health
and behavior of the northern mockingbird Mimus poly-
glottos. Our pilot work suggests that lead levels in
mockingbird adults may be associated with increases
in aggressive behavior. The student working on this
project will characterize pathways of lead uptake; relate
exposure to physiological condition, cognition, aggres-
sive behavior and reproductive success; and explore the
mechanistic (genomic and endocrine) underpinnings of
these eects. Please see http://karubian.tulane.edu/-

Project Description: Majority of terrestrial N2O emis-
sions contributing to global warming are produced by
microbial nitriers (ammonia oxidising archaea (AOA)
and bacteria (AOB)). Molecular techniques enable study
of the diversity and activity of AOA and AOB and have
identied characteristics important in determining their
ecology and evolution. Given rst evidence of dieren-
tial selection of AOA and AOB depending on the sources
of applied fertiliser N, more knowledge are required re-
garding the evolutionary and ecological ammonia-based
niche dierentiation in AOA and AOB.
This PhD studentship aims to determine these evolution-
ary and ecological mechanisms resulting in ammonia-
based niche dierentiation in AOA and AOB. Soil micro-
cosm experiments will be complemented by amplicon-
genome and whole-genome sequencings. Through phy-
logenetic ancestral reconstructions and comparative ge-
nomics approaches, these data will be used to under-
stand niche dierentiation and evolution between and
within AOA and AOB.

Living on the edge - Lesser black-backed gulls foraging
and breeding at a coastal-urban interface
Lesser black-backed gulls once successfully adapted to
anthropogenic environments, indicating a high degree
of behavioural plasticity. They are also considered to
be generalist feeders with a wide ecological niche. But
most individuals do not exploit the complete range of
habitats and resources that are available, they rather
specialize. However, the adaptive signicance of such
specialization likely depends on the predictability of
the environment, which at current becomes increasingly
unreliable - among others due to human-induced envi-
ronmental changes.
The PhD project aims at investigating how reproduc-
tive decisions vary with the ability of an individual to
respond to environmental and anthropogenic changes,
and how the costs and benets of individual speciali-
sation relate to trade-os throughout the annual cycle
(including migration, nest-site selection and reproduc-
tion). This will be studied in eld experiments via large
scale behavioural observations of individually marked
(colour-ringed) birds in collaboration with the Research
Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO). This will be
combined with the implementation of state-of-the-art
GPS tracking devices that collect detailed information
about individual movements and behaviour 24h/24h via
the high tech sensor network (LifeWatch Infrastructure)
in collaboration with Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ).
We are seeking a highly motivated, enthusiastic and
creative person with a Master in Biology or a related
eld. You must have good communication skills and be
able to work in a team. You have a strong interest in
Behavioural Ecology and Conservation, previous experi-
ence in related research and eldwork would be helpful.
The post is a full-time four-year PhD position from 1
March 2018 onwards (starting date negotiable).

UBath EvolutionGeneDuplications
PhD studentship: How have gene family duplications

Understanding the forces that shape global biodiver-54 EvolDir December 1, 2017
sity patterns was identied as one of the 25 greatest
challenges for Science in the 21st Century (1, 2). Some
mammal clades are enormously diverse, while their sis-
ter groups (originating at the same time) are far less so
(e.g., 1,500 species of rodents versus 80 species of rabbits,
hares and their allies). Why is this, and what might
these dierences tell us about the likely responses of
groups to the present biodiversity crisis? In this strongly
inter-disciplinary project, we will investigate the pos-
sible role of Small Scale Duplications of genes (SSDs)
in shaping patters of diversity, anatomical complexity
(3, 4) and morphological disparity (5-7) of mammals in
deep time.
As noted by Ernst Haeckel, developmental trajectories
tend to become more complex with macroevolutionary
time. Increasing interdependencies between genes and
systems, coupled with their co-option for multiple func-
tions (pleiotropy), result in more deleterious collateral
consequences of mutations. This predicts that aspects of
bodyplan design may become arbitrarily 'locked down'
(e.g. seven neck vertebrae in most mammals), and that
evolutionary innovation will be commonest when genetic
redundancy is highest.
Small Scale Duplications of genes (SSDs) increase the
number of genes within a given gene family (gene fam-
ily size, GFS), and are one way in which mammals
may circumvent such pleiotropic constraints and facil-
itate innovation. This project will use a variety of
genomic, phylogenetic palaeontological and comparative
approaches (8) to investigate the relationship between
the timing and phylogenetic placement of SSDs, the
diversity (species richness) and disparity (morphologi-
cal diversity) of clades, and the anatomical complexity
(serial dierentiation) of the vertebrae and limbs of the
species within those clades.
Applicants must have obtained, or be about to obtain,
a First or Upper Second Class UK Honours degree (or
the equivalent qualications gained outside the UK) in
an appropriate area of science or technology. In addi-
tion, due to the strong mathematical component of the
taught course in the rst year and the quantitative em-
phasis in SWBio DTP projects, a minimum of a grade
B in A-level Maths (or an equivalent qualication or
experience) is required.

UBath SexRoleEvolution
PROJECT TITLE: Sex role evolution: phylogenetic
analyses of mating and parenting in vertebrates
Main Supervisor: Professor Tam as Sz ekely, University
of Bath, UK Co-Supervisor: Dr Daniel J Field, Uni-
versity of Bath, UK Co-Supervisor: Prof Innes Cuthill,
University of Bristol. UK
Project Enquiries: T.Szekely@bath.ac.uk
Project Background Sex roles (e.g. courtship, mate
choice, pair bonding and parenting) are immensely di-
verse social behaviours. Recent research has uncovered
key elements of sex role variation, but signicant uncer-
tainties remain. Appropriate sexual behaviour in nature
is essential for reproduction, and thus understanding sex
roles is critical for evolutionary biology and population
biology. Understanding sex roles is also important for
biodiversity conservation since disruptions to normal
sexual behaviour due to environmental changes may
reduce population viability. A general trend in social
behaviour is that females tend to be the caring sex,
whereas males focus more on mating; however there
are illuminating exceptions. This division of sex roles
has far-reaching eects on ecology, physiology and life
histories of males and females. The causes, however,
of sex role dierentiation have remained controversial.
This PhD project is focused on understanding the causes
of sex role evolution in vertebrates using phylogenetic
approaches.December 1, 2017 EvolDir 55
Project Aims and Methods This PhD project will focus
on vertebrates (i.e. shes, amphibians, reptiles, birds
and mammals) that exhibit particularly well-studied sex
role behaviour. The PhD project has three objectives:
1. to investigate the association between key compo-
nents of sex roles: courtship, competition for mates,
pair bonding and parental care; 2. to examine the in-
uence of variation in ecology, life- history and social
environment on sex roles; 3. to investigate the multi-way
feedbacks between sex roles, environment, life histories
and the social environment using phylogenetic tools.
These objectives will be addressed using (i) detailed
information on courtship, pair bonding and parental
behavior collected by Prof Szekely's team from multiple
bird populations, and (ii) across vertebrates based on
published data in the literature. This will be a challeng-
ing and stimulating project that can potentially produce
cutting edge results. The student will not only benet
from the excellent facilities at Bath and Bristol, but
also from interacting with top international scientists
involved in the project. Fieldwork in exotic locations
can be negotiated.
Candidate The ideal candidate has a strong interest in
evolution, phylogenetic methods and behaviour, and
direct experience working with any vertebrate taxon.
Excellent quantitative skills are required to perform phy-
logenetic comparative analyses and run mathematical
simulations. Innovative thinking will be necessary to
draw links between disparate sources of data.
Training The training will focus on three major skills:
1. Phylogenetic analyses: this includes inferring phylo-
genies and using trees in a comparative framework for
testing macroevolutionary hypotheses. Training in com-
putational and advanced statistical methods will be a
focus of this PhD; 2. Fieldwork including experimental
design, behavioural observations, estimating ecological
and life-history variables in the eld; 3. Transferable
skills including research planning, statistical analyses,
paper writing, presentation and communication skills.

UBern 2 SpeciationGenomics
Two PhD positions:
Speciation genomics of rodents and their microbes
Applications are invited for two PhD positions investi-
gating the genomic processes of evolutionary divergence
and hybridization in rodents and their feedback on asso-
ciated microbes. Research will deepen and extend our
comparative analyses of dierent stages of speciation
in Microtus voles. This will contribute to answering
fundamental questions in evolutionary biology such as:
What is the importance of adaptive and neutral pro-
cesses during evolutionary divergence? How tight is the
association between fast-evolving microorganisms and
processes of speciation in their hosts? Does divergence
and diversity of hosts limit or expand the evolutionary
scope of associated microorganisms? We will address
this through comparative analyses of vole and RNA
virus genomes and of microbial communities based on
high-throughput sequence data from several Microtus
hybrid zones with dierent levels of divergence. The two
PhD candidates will focus on dierent aspects of the
system (host, microbiome, virus, selection, demography,
population structure, etc.) depending on the specic
qualications and interests.
I am looking for skilled, creative and highly-motivated
candidates who are able to work independently and
in a team. Candidates must have a solid background
in evolutionary biology, and practical experience with
bioinformatics applications and analysis methods in pop-
ulation genetics and/or phylogenetics. Much of the work
will concern the processing and analysis of large genomic
data sets generated by the candidates. Experience with
molecular laboratory work or eldwork on small mam-
mals is a plus but not essential. A Master degree in
a relevant eld and a valid driver's license is required.56 EvolDir December 1, 2017
The project includes short periods of eldwork, and
the writing of several manuscripts for leading scientic
journals.
We oer a very stimulating, multi-national research com-
munity with excellent infrastructure. We are also part of
the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB) which broad-
ens the opportunities for further training beyond courses
in various doctoral programs. The working language
in our institute is English. Some knowledge of German
or French is benecial for living in Switzerland but it
is not essential. Bern and Switzerland are consistently
ranked among the places with the highest quality of life.
The positions are funded by the Swiss National Sci-
ence Foundation for a maximum of four years. The
anticipated starting date is early 2018. Please send

When and how does adaptation prevent extinction due
to climate change? Testing for evolutionary change at
contracting range margins of European butteriesDecember 1, 2017 EvolDir 57
(Supervisors; Dr Jon Bridle, University of Bristol, Dr
Rob Wilson, University of Exeter)
We are looking for a highly-motivated student to test
the ecological eects of climate change on buttery com-
munities, and the role of evolution in increasing their
resilience. Profound eects on ecosystem function are
predicted as climate change generates rapid shifts in
species' geographical distributions. Many organisms
have already contracted their ranges at equatorial mar-
gins to higher altitudes, and expanded their ranges as
their poleward margins become increasingly habitable.
However, these responses seem limited by rates of evo-
lution. Although most generalist species have shifted
their ranges, most specialist species remain trapped in
increasingly fragmented habitats, apparently because
they cannot adapt to local conditions at their ecolog-
ical margins. Dening critical levels of environmental
change therefore depends on understanding how eas-
ily (and how quickly) evolutionary rescue can occur at
ecological margins.
This project will explore evolution in European but-
teries at their southern (contacting) margins in com-
parison to that observed at their northern (expanding)
margins. Adaptive divergence may be easier at contract-
ing margins because population sizes are initially high,
making genetic variation locally available. By contrast,
at expanding margins evolution may require the spread
of novel mutations from distant populations, or may
cause the rapid loss of adaptive variation.
You will: (i) conduct buttery and host plant surveys in
central Spain, and comparing their thermal niches to our
previous data; (ii) Use population genomics to test for
local adaptation at contracting range margins in com-
parison to those involved in poleward expansions; (iii)
conduct eld transplant experiments to test for adaptive
divergence in maternal behaviour and larval survival and
and by testing larval growth rate at dierent altitudes.
You will be based at the University of Bristol, and will
include two eld seasons in Madrid, and time at the
University of Exeter. You will receive expert training in
population ecology and genomics, spatial ecology, and
the application of evolutionary theory to conservation
policy.

PhD positions in Sensory System Evolution / Vision
Science
>From ancient genes to focused eyes: The Buschbeck
laboratory uses exciting new tools to probe fundamental
and crucial questions of visual system evolution, func-
tion and development in invertebrate models. How do
deeply conserved genes and gene networks contribute to
the development of extraordinary image-forming eyes?
One research project utilizes RNAi knockdown and fo-
cuses on when, where and what known eye development
genes are expressed during the development of highly
unusual beetle larval eyes, with complementary exper-
iments in the genetically powerful Drosophila system.
Another research direction utilizes a newly developed,
unique micro-ophthalmoscope to perform vision tests
on the smallest of all eyes. The goal of that project
is to investigate how invertebrates coordinate the op-
tical power of the lens and underlying photoreceptors.
Do invertebrates, like vertebrates, need visual input to
develop and maintain correctly focused eyes? This im-
portant question is especially interesting in the light of
rapid and dramatic eye growth that often takes place
when animals molt. More details on our NSF spon-
sored research, additional projects, the lab's research
community and mentoring are available at: http://-

PlantComputationalGenomics
The Plant Computational Genomics lab in the Depart-
ment of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the Uni-
versity of Connecticut seeks motivated PhD and MS
students to join the lab in the Summer/Fall 2018. Our re-
search focuses on the computational analysis of genomic
and transcriptomic data generated by next-generation
sequencing platforms from non-model forest tree species.
We implement this through analysis related to gene
nding, gene expression, transcriptome assembly, and
conserved element identication, through machine learn-
ing and computational statistics. We use these methods
to address questions related to genome biology and pop-
ulation genomics. In addition, we develop web-based
applications that integrate BIG data across domains
to facilitate the forest geneticist or ecologist's ability
to analyze, share, and visualize their data ( http://-
treegenesdb.org). Such integration requires the imple-
mentation of semantic technologies and ontologies to
connect genotype, phenotype, and environmental re-
sources. We actively contribute to the open source
Tripal ( http://tripal.info) project with these goals in
mind.
RESEARCH TOPICS: Potential research topics in our
group include 1) development of visualization tools to
support genome-wide association studies in forest trees;
2) application of genomic and transcriptomic techniques
to evaluate the impact of climate change on tree popu-
lations; 3) development of software solutions to improve
assembly and characterization of non-model plant tran-
scriptomes; 4) interrogation of natural genetic variation

EndosymbiontsInsectPhylogenomics
PhD Student Position Insect Phylogenomics Micro-
biomes, Endosymbionts, in the Simon Lab, UConn
The Simon lab at the University of Connecticut seeks cre-
ative and motivated PhD students interested in phyloge-
netics, molecular phylogenomics, bioinformatics, and/or
symbiont-host interactions (endosymbionts and/or mi-
crobiomes) to begin in the fall of 2018. Experience
preferred but not required.
Applicants will participate in an NSF sponsored project
entitled: Exploring Symbiont Biodiversity and Com-
plexity in the Family Cicadidae to study the co-
diversication and interaction between cicadas, their
primary obligate endosymbionts, their secondary facul-
tative endosymbionts and their gut microbiota.
Cicada obligate endosymbionts have recently been
demonstrated to exhibit spectacular and unprecedented
genome diversity. Since cicada symbionts are largely un-
known our work will result in considerable biodiversity
discovery. We hypothesize that gain or loss of host-
symbiont consortium members during cicada phyloge-
netic history will be correlated with internal or external
environmental changes. We are most interested in the
timing of symbiont consortium changes. For example,
does the gain of a secondary (facultative) endosymbiont
facilitate the breakdown or loss of primary (obligate)
endosymbionts? Or does the breakdown or loss of the
obligate endosymbiont allow invasion by a secondary
endosymbiont? Broader impacts will involve collabo-
rations with team members in the US, India, NZ, and
Fiji.
Senior Personnel and collaborators on the project in-
clude: Thomas Buckley (NZ), David Marshall, John
Cooley, John McCutcheon, Emily and Alan Lemmon,

Daniela Takiya (BR), Tatiana Ruschel (BR), Pablo Pes-
sacq (Argentina), Claudio Veloso (Chile), Peter Lock-
hart (NZ, FJ), and numerous cicada researchers around
the world.
Interested and qualied PhD candidates should send an
email describing their motivation, skills, and researchexperience/interests along with a CV, GPA, GRE and
TOEFL (if relevant) scores. Applicants should also ar-
range to have letters sent letters sent by three referees
who are familiar with the candidates work. Strong ap-
plicants will be contacted to schedule an informal Skype
interview. Applications to UCONN (early admission)
are due December 15th with rolling admission thereafter.
Financial support for Ph.D. students is available via
research assistantships from our NSF award, teaching as-
sistantships, and university fellowships, but applications
to outside funding sources are also strongly encouraged.
Send all material to chris.simon@uconn.edu The suc-
cessful candidates will join the EEB Department at the
University of Connecticut and also have opportunities
to work in the laboratories of collaborators. The EEB
department is a diverse, highly collegial and interactive
group of scientists. Relevant to these positions, we are
particularly strong in Systematics with eight faculty
members whose major focus is phylogenetic systematics
and half a dozen others who use phylogenetics in their
work. We oer three graduate courses in systematics
(Principles and Methods of Systematics, Molecular Sys-
tematics, and Phylogenetic Systematics) plus numerous
relevant grad seminars. There is a strong symbiont
group on campus that includes members of EEB and
Molecular and Cell Biology. EEB also has strengths in
phenotypic plasticity and functional morphology, global
change ecology, behavior, and organismal evolution, ecol-
ogy and conservation.

UEastAnglia IslandAvianEvolution
Aim: To understand the temporal evolution of immuno-
genetic diversity in wild animals.
In the face of changing environments, genetic variation is
essential for the survival of individuals and populations,
and thus underpins biodiversity. How genetic diversity
is generated and maintained in populations is, therefore,
an important evolutionary question with ramications
for everything from epidemiology to conservation.
Pathogens are a strong selective force so it is not surpris-
ing that immune genes are often extremely polymorphic.
However, we lack fundamental understanding of the
rate at which host immunogenetic variation changes
over time in natural vertebrate populations, how dif-
ferent genetic mechanisms facilitate it, and the relative
inuence of genetic drift and selection in this.
The student will use genomic capture techniques to
screen variation in Berthelot's pipit at 132 already im-
mune identied loci. Using a combination of museum
specimens (1820s), previously collected samples (2006)
and eldwork (2019) they will measure changes in im-
munogenetic variation across time in multiple isolated
populations of this species.Our previous work has identied dierences between
these populations (in population size and pathogen
regimes), which provide axes of variation against which
to test temporal patterns of immunogentic change.
The student will investigate: 1. The rate of immuno-
genetic change in a wild-living bird; 2. The role of
mutational rates or mechanisms in enabling change at
immune genes; 3. The relative importance of drift and
pathogen-mediated selection in driving immunogenetic
evolution; 4. The role of dierent selection mechanisms
that can act to maintain variation in natural popula-
tions.
Research Environment and Training Supervised by Prof
David Richardson and Dr Lewis Spurgin (UEA), with
Dr Brent Emerson (CSIC), the student will join a dy-
namic, collaborative research community at UEA, and
spend at least 3 months at CSIC, (CASE partner re-
search institute in Tenerife) directly interacting with
researchers.
The student will receive specialized training in ecolog-
ical eldwork, molecular genetics, bioinformatics and
data analysis. They will also receive extensive training
from NERC/UEA to increase generic scientic skills
and enhance employability.

training opportunity to understand how individuals
respond to their social and sexual environment. You
will gain research skills in cutting-edge genetic, genomic
manipulations, bioinformatics and cellular microscopy
and receive excellent training and career development
from the thriving Norwich Biosciences Doctoral
Training Partnership and from the collaboration with
Professor Clive Wilson at the University of Oxford.
An important part of being successful and competitive
is to respond to the rapidly changing environments in
which we often nd ourselves. Fruity males are able to
show highly precise responses to their social and sexual
environment. Following detection of conspecic rivals,
males transfer more ejaculate proteins to females and
sire more ospring. They are even able to alter the
composition of the ejaculate that they transfer. Males
can switch their 'rivals responses' on and o with great
accuracy and speed.
The overarching aim is to nd out how males can do this.
Our recent studies support the hypothesis that males
can potentially use dierent mechanisms, to turn genes
on / o, remove inhibitors of gene expression and change
the way that ejaculate proteins are made and expelled.
The student will test this and determine the temporal
sequence of events. They will use phenotypic proling
to assess the eect of genetic manipulations of accessory
glands, measure changes to gene and non-coding RNA
expression using bioinformatics, and prole structural
and signaling changes using high resolution microscopy.

UEdinburgh 2 EvolutionaryGenetics
Dear all,
I would like to advertise two PhD projects on the
evolutionary and reproductive genetics of insects in
my lab at the University of Edinburgh starting Octo-
ber 2018 https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=-
hTtM8jkAAAAJ&hl=en. There are funding options for
both UK and international students. If you are inter-
ested please contact me directly (laura.ross@ed.ac.uk)to discuss, deadlines vary depending on funding source.
Below are the project descriptions:
Sexual conict and genome evolution in haplodiploid
organisms
https://www.ndaphd.com/search/-
ProjectDetails.aspx?PJID=90109 Sexual conicts
result from a clash of interests between the sexes [1]. In
many cases, this battle is fought at the level of the gene:
males and females may dier with respect to which
version of a gene maximizes their Darwinian tness.
Whilst the eects of such intralocus sexual conicts
have been studied intensively in many organisms, the
vast majority of studies have focused on species with
classical, diploid sexual reproduction. However, as
many as 15% of animal species exhibit an alternative,
haplodiploid mode of inheritance. In such species,
mothers monopolize the production of male ospring,
either by asexual production of sons or by producing
sons that eliminate their father's genome after the
zygote stage [2]. This asymmetrical mode of inheritance
is likely to aect the outcome of intralocus sexual
conict. Specically, as alleles that favour male tness
cannot be passed on directly from fathers to sons,
sexual conicts may be resolved in favour of females
[2]. The aim of this project is to study the fate of
alleles under intralocus sexual conict in a range of
haplodiploid taxa. Studying such exceptions to the
general rules of reproduction provides illumination of
the fundamental principles of evolutionary genetics (see
[3] for a recent comparable example). This project
will combine laboratory experiments, gene expression
studies and genome analyses. We will focus particularly
on springtails and fungus gnats, as males in these
species carry and express their father's genomes, but
do not pass them on to their ospring. In addition,
these species still retain recognizable sex chromosomes,
which enables informative sex chromosome / autosome
comparisons (e.g. [3]). These experimental approaches
will be combined with comparative phylogenetic
analyses and the development of novel evolutionary
theory, according to the interests of the student.
The project will be supervised by Dr. Laura Ross (Ed-
inburgh, http://lauraross.bio.ed.ac.uk) and Dr. Andy
Gardner (St. Andrews). Ross is an evolutionary biolo-
gist who uses a combination of genomic, empirical and
phylogenetic approaches to study the evolution and evo-
lutionary consequences of dierent types of reproduction
among the animal kingdom. Gardner is a leading math-
ematical biologist whose works spans a wide range of
topics in theoretical biology and genetics. The proposed
project strongly rest upon the collaboration between
the supervisors as, on the one hand, formalization of
the relevant theoretical hypotheses is currently lacking64 EvolDir December 1, 2017
and, on the other hand, empirical work is required for
estimation of key model parameters. The candidate will
be based primarily in Edinburgh, as required by the
empirical work, but will spend 1-2 days per month in St.
Andrews for the duration of the project, as well as two
1-2 month intensive visits to the Gardner lab in years 2
and 3.

the two copies of a gene - one from their mother, the
other from their father - are interchangeable. But
sometimes this rule is violated. In a process called
genomic imprinting the expression of one of the two
copies of a gene is privileged, depending on its parental
origin. Genomic imprinting is studied extensively in
mammals and plants and most biologists consider it
exclusive to these groups. In fact imprinting was rst
discovered in a dierent group, the insects, in the 1950s,
decades before its discovery elsewhere [1]. Since then

MASSIVELY PARALLEL PHYLOGENY RECON-
STRUCTION FOR THE AGE OF DNA BIG DATA
Supervisors: Dr Daniel Barker, University of Edin-
burgh, UK, Daniel.Barker@ed.ac.uk Professor ThomasMeagher, University of St Andrews, UK
The goal is to create re-usable, eective, portable parallel
algorithms and open-source software for reconstructing
large phylogenies. This would represent a step-change
for phylogeny reconstruction, which is now central to
many areas of life sciences, from biodiversity and con-
servation to cancer research. Phylogeny research, a
central element of many aspects of modern biology, has
been transformed by the availability of DNA sequences,
with an explosion in generation and use of such data.
Moreover, access to extended data platforms and sci-
entic challenges has increased the scale, in terms of
numbers of species, over which phylogeny research is
conducted. The resulting Big Data is placing a strain
on computational phylogeny. To nd the optimal tree-
like phylogeny according to current criteria, ideally one
would evaluate all possible tree topologies. However,
the number of topologies increases factorially with the
number of extant entities in the tree. For just 54 species
'V a small study by current standards 'V there are
more possible topologies than atoms in the universe.
The project will address Big Data challenges for phy-
logeny research through theoretical and computational
approaches. These will include use and characterisation
of nature-inspired advanced heuristics (e.g. Strobl and
Barker 2016), programming and use of massively par-
allel computer systems, optimisation of algorithms and
implementations, and cross-site, distributed machine
learning techniques. Research training will be provided
in phylogeny reconstruction, programming, software en-
gineering, high performance computing and machine
learning. This will be provided through meetings with
the supervisors; meetings/visits and discussion with
Dr Martyn Winn (STFC Scientic Computing Depart-
ment); attendance at short courses and conferences; and
attendance at local and regional seminars and discus-
sion groups. It is anticipated the successful candidate
would gain valuable skills and insight for employment
in phylogeny, high-performance computing, life sciences
research and/or machine learning in academia or indus-
try.

PlantGenomeDuplication
Genome duplication in parasitic plants: features and
consequences
The University of Edinburgh, UK
Supervisors: Mark Blaxter, Institute of Evolutionary
Biology.
Alex Twyford, Institute of Evolutionary Biology.
Project background Parasitism is a ubiquitous feature
of the natural world, found in every major organismal
group, and across every ecosystem. In plants, parasitism
is an extremely successful strategy that has evolved inde-
pendently on at least a dozen occasions. There are over
4000 parasitic species. These parasitic plants include
crop pests (Orobanche, Striga) and ecosystem engineers
that aect community assembly (Rhinanthus and many
hemiparasites). Studies of parasitic plants are essential
for improving food security and in understanding ecosys-
tem services, while also providing important insights
into the origin of novel evolutionary strategies.
A major goal in parasitic plant biology is to understand
the genetic basis of the parasitic habit. Comparative
transciptomic analyses identied ~180 genes upregu-
lated in the haustorium (the parasite attachment organ)
shared between three divergent taxa (Yang et al., 2015).
Many of these genes are the products of gene duplication
that has occurred since divergence from non-parasitic
relatives. This raises the question of whether genome
duplication plays an important role in the origin of plant
parasitism.
This project will use genomic tools to investigate the
presence and evolutionary fate of duplicate gene copies
in parasitic eyebrights (Euphrasia). These generalist
parasitic plant species are extremely ecologically diverse,
and include a number of recently evolved UK endemics ofconservation concern. They are particularly well-suited
to genomic analysis because they have small genomes
compared to other parasitic plants. The research project
will involve:
- assembling the nuclear genome of a diploid Euphrasia
species from next generation and single-molecule data -
assembling the genome of a tetraploid Euphrasia
- performing gene nding and rich functional annotation
using RNA-seq data
- comparing diploid and tetraploid Euphrasia (and re-
lated non-parasitic taxa) to identify retained duplicates
and explore their functions and evolutionary histories
- using low-coverage and resequencing data from all 19
British native taxa and new lines collected from Eu-
ropean populations that may represent independent
genome duplication events to explore pattern and pro-
cess of duplicate evolution across the genus.
These new insights will be essential for understanding
the evolution of plant parasitism, and may represent
a step towards developing genetic tools for control of
devastating crop parasites.

Industrial CASE PhD studentship
Project Details: The purpose of this multidisciplinary
studentship is to integrate fundamental and applied
perspectives on a research problem with direct societal
relevance but which also informs key questions in evolu-
tionary ecology and parasitology. The development of
resistance to chemical control measures is a key concern
in human and veterinary medicine and in agricultural
production systems. To increase the eciency and ef-
fectiveness of chemical control measures in the face of
resistance, adaptive management approaches have been
proposed that customise intervention strategies to the
biology and ecology of the particular target pathogens
and their hosts. However, these would ideally consider
the specic mechanisms of the control agent, genetics of
resistance, rates of migration between susceptible and
resistant populations, and the strength of selection im-
posed by the control agents, while taking into account

infections. This requires integration of ecology, evolu-
tion, genetics/genomics, parasitology, veterinary science,
quantitative analyses of \big data", and mathematical
modelling, which has not often been achieved.
The overall aim of this studentship is to take a mul-
tidisciplinary approach to investigate the nature and
consequences of anthelmintic resistance in an important
parasite of sheep, the nematode Haemonchus contor-
tus. The project will focus on resistance to ivermectin,
which is one of the key anthelmintics for controlling
livestock parasites. The student will benet from sup-
port and resources provided by a large UK-wide con-
sortium investigating anthelmintic resistance (https://-
bugconsortium.wordpress.com). The project will involve
four main elements but there will be exibility for the
student to take the project in dierent directions: 1)
using previously developed crosses between resistant
and susceptible parasites to test the genetic basis of
resistance; 2) examining 'real life' tness (e.g. ability
to establish infection, competition, mating success) and
the inuence of mating preferences, by genotyping the
adults and progeny resulting from mixed infections; 3)
testing the segregation of resistance markers in previ-
ously established lines of a free-living nematode model
system (Caenorhabditis remanei) that was selected for
ivermectin resistance to test whether there is a common
basis of resistance and similar phenotypic consequences;
and 4) using deep sequencing approaches to genotype
individuals from agricultural environments that dier
in resistance management practices to test predictions
about expected rates of resistance evolution.
The student will spend at least 3 months per year with
the Industrial CASE partner (Moredun Scientic), to
receive specic training in the requirements of the an-
imal health industry involved in the development and
registration of veterinary medicines. The company has
a remit to promote animal health and welfare through
research and education, with a particular focus on ther-
apeutics and vaccines.

Positions are available for one postdoc and two MSc and
one Ph.D. positions to investigate the foraging ecology
and genetics of two cleaner sh species that forage on
parasitic lice attached to Atlantic salmon.
The postdoctoral position begins in May 2018 and is
funded for two years. The two MSc. positions begin in
January or May 2018 and are funded for two years. The
Ph.D. position begins in January or May 2018 and is
funded for four years.
The project is led by Professor Elizabeth Boulding (In-
tegrative Biology, U. Guelph) with co-investigator Pro-
fessor Emeritus Larry Schaeer (Animal Biosciences, U.
Guelph). Our industrial collaborators are led by Dr.
K.P. Ang of Kelly Cove Salmon Ltd. (KCS) a division of
Cooke Aquaculture Inc. (CAI). They include Dr. J.A.K.
Elliott, Dr. M. Herlin, F. Powell from KCS, and Dr. T.
M. Jonassen from Akvaplan-Niva, Norway.
The objective of this NSERC Strategic Project is to pro-
vide a sustainable and pedigreed source of cleaner sh
to reduce lice densities found on Atlantic salmon living
in marine sea cages in Eastern Canada. This project
will develop highly-repeatable methods of measuring the68 EvolDir December 1, 2017
functional responses of two proven cleaner shes: the
lumpsh (Cyclopterus lumpus) and the cunner (Tauto-
golabrus adspersus). An outcome of this project will
be a breeding program for lice-eating performance by
lumpsh and by cunners at two existing hatcheries op-
erated by CAI. It will also deepen our understanding
of the reciprocal evolution of early mutualisms between
facultative cleaner shes and their clients.
MSc. student position 1 (behavioural ecology of shes)
will help develop methods of predicting lice-cleaning
performance of cunners in marine sea cages from ob-
servations of their performance in indoor tanks. This
will involve comparing condition-dependent performance
among dierent families of cunners from dierent geo-
graphical regions that have been reared in a common
environment. Cunner lice-removal performance in ma-
rine sea cages will be assessed using video-footage and
by examining their stomach contents.
MSc student position 2 (molecular ecol-
ogy/bioinformatics) will help develop DNA markers
to estimate pedigrees for cleaner sh families spawned
in the hatcheries. This position will involve high
throughput DNA extraction, and bioinformatics using
a high-performance computer cluster. This research
will identify DNA markers that show larger than
expected amounts of genetic divergence among cunner
populations and among lumpsh populations from
dierent geographical areas.
Ph.D. student (applied evolution/behavioural ecology
of shes) will help develop methods of predicting lice-
cleaning performance of lumpsh in marine sea cages
from their performance in tanks. This will involve com-
paring condition-dependent performance among dier-
ent families of lumpsh from dierent geographical re-
gions that have been reared in a common environment.
Lumpsh lice-removal performance in marine sea cages
will be assessed using video-footage and by examining
their stomach contents. Relationships between tradi-
tional and DNA barcoding of stomach contents will be
compared for lumpsh and for cunners and used to de-
velop non-lethal methods of monitoring the prevalence
of lice in their diets. This may lead to a deeper under-
standing of environmental factors aecting facultative
lice-cleaning performance in the eld.
Postdoctoral fellow (with experience in sh applied evo-
lution/applied ethology/behavioural ecology) will help
the graduate students develop repeatable methods of
measuring posing and other co-operative behaviors by
client sh that facilitate parasite-removal by cleaner
shes. Their own project will involve assisting with
salmon lice tank challenges of pedigreed Atlantic salmon
and measuring posing rates near cleaner sh refuges. Itwill also involve video-assisted eld observations of client
behavior near cleaner-sh refuges within marine sea
cages. The postdoc will be trained to estimate breeding
values for lice-cleaning performance by the cleaner sh
and for posing performance by their Atlantic salmon
clients. Creating a breeding nucleus containing only
cleaner sh and client sh with high breeding values for
performance traits would be predicted to increase the
reciprocal co-evolution of this mutualism in marine sea
cages.
Please apply for the postdoctoral, Ph.D. or MSc. po-
sitions by sending an email to Dr. Boulding (bould-
ing@uoguelph.ca) with attachments containing: 1) your
curriculum vitae/resume, 2) an electronic transcript of
all your university grades, 3) a list of referees with their
email addresses and telephone numbers, 4) pdf reprints
of your scientic publications (if any), and 5) a state-
ment that you are willing to travel from Guelph to New
Brunswick and Newfoundland for eldwork as needed.
She will then request references from the referees of
qualied applicants.

of TEs in both the soma and the germline. Students
interested in this project should be familiar with Shell
scripting and computer programming.
2) The evolution of the early embryonic transcriptome
in Drosophila species: Embryonic transcriptomes from
diverse species can be readily compared due to similar-
ities in embryonic stages. We are analyzing transcrip-
tomes from dierent stages of early embryogenesis in
Drosophila species. Students interested in this project
should be prepared for molecular lab work, bioinformatic
analysis and possible eld collection of samples.
Interested students should send an email to jatal-

In previous research, the Davison-lab led an interna-
tional team dedicated to nding the gene that deter-
mines mirror image development (\chirality") in the
pond snail,|Lymnaea stagnalis. More generally, we are
using molluscan genomics, with projects dedicated to
nding evolutionary interesting genes, whether chiral
variation in Japanese|Euhadra|or the colour polymor-
phism / supergene of|Cepaea. Field work and foreign
lab work is always an option - recent students spent
5 months in a German lab or undertook eld work in
Japan. The lab also has a strong background in|science
communication, with a recent science-related story from
the lab reaching an estimated 1.9 billion people (!)
Project #1: \The evolution and development of left-
right asymmetry in snails"
Project supervisors: Dr Angus Davison and Dr William
Brown, University of Nottingham, UK.
While invariant left/right asymmetry appears to be the
rule in nearly all animals, until recently it has not been
clear if the path to asymmetry is conserved. In recent re-
search we identied the one in a billion base pair change
that determines mirror image development (\chirality")
in the pond snail. As we also showed that the same gene
is similarly involved in setting up asymmetry in the frog,
then our work that began in snails ultimately revealed
one of the earliest common symmetry-breaking steps
across the whole of the Bilateria. The next stage is to
'unravel' symmetry breaking at the molecular and cellu-
lar level, in particular to nd the set of genes that rst
establish asymmetry. In this exciting and fast-moving,
the student will seek to understand the mechanics of
the very earliest symmetry-breaking steps using Lym-
naea stagnalis pond snails, or another species. Most
likely, this will involve a range of techniques, from micro-
manipulation to genomics/bioinformatics, and possibly
eldwork - with the balance determined by the interests
of the student.
The project is competitively funded through
the 'Molecules, Cells and Organisms' stream
of the Nottingham|BBSRC DTP.|http://-

UOtago EvolutionEpigenetics
PhD in Epigenetic Theory at University of Otago,
Dunedin, NEW ZEALAND
A PhD position is available within the Department of
Zoology at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New
Zealand. This position in the laboratory of Professor
Hamish G. Spencer is funded by the Marsden Fund of
the Royal Society of New Zealand. A scholarship cover-
ing fees plus a tax-free stipend of NZ $27,500 per year is
available for three years.
The project is part of a larger project entitled \Epi-
genetics and Evolutionary Theory." Just as natural
populations exhibit genetic variation, so too do they
harbour epigenetic variation, some of which is trans-
mitted from one generation to the next. This project74 EvolDir December 1, 2017
asks how we can explain this transgenerationally in-
herited epigenetic variation in natural populations and
what might be the consequences for evolution. The can-
didate will construct and analyse novel mathematical
models to investigate these matters, validating these
models with data from real examples, and using the
models to make novel predictions about the properties
of epigenetic variation in nature.
The successful candidate will have a strong interest in
applying quantitative methods in biology. They will
have a degree (e.g., BSc(Hons), MSc) in biology and/or
mathematics (or a related eld) that included a research
component (e.g., a dissertation or a thesis).
Our research group and the wider Department includes
world-class research sta, facilities and strong interna-
tional collaborations, oering excellent opportunities to
gain a variety of highly pertinent research and technical
skills.
Dunedin, in the South Island of New Zealand, is a great

UppsalaU EvolutionaryGeneticsSex-
ualDimorphism
PhD position available to study evolutionary genetics
of sexual dimorphism
This is a fully funded 4-year position in the Evolution-
ary Biology section at the Department of Ecology and
Genetics, Uppsala University, Sweden. The PhD pro-
gram is in evolutionary genetics. The Department is
highly international, with evolutionary biology research
currently ranked as 7th best in the world (by CWUR).
Our research spans from evolutionary ecology and ge-
netics to studies of ecosystems. For more information,
please see www.ieg.uu.se . The advertised PhD project
seeks answers to one of the fundamental questions inevolutionary biology: how does a single genome produce
sexually dimorphic phenotypes? Sexual dimorphism,
from morphology and physiology to behaviors, is nearly
ubiquitous in nature. Yet, genetic correlations due to
the largely shared genome between the sexes impose
constraint to independent trait evolution in the sexes.
The PhD candidate will investigate tness consequences
and the genetic architecture of evolution of genetic cor-
relations between the sexes, using articial selection,
phenotypic assaying and modern RNA and DNA se-
quencing technologies. The work will be carried out
with Callosobruchus maculatus seed beetles, a highly
amenable model system in sexual selection and conict
research. The results from this research program will
be important for understanding how genetics can con-
strain and resolve adaptive evolution in the sexes and
thus shape the most notable form of variation within
species, i.e. sexual dimorphism. Beyond basic research,
understanding the dynamics of sex-specic genetic archi-
tecture is important within the context of biomedicine
and sex dierences in disease.
The lead-supervisor, Ass. Prof. Elina Immo-
nen, focuses on studying sex-specic selection and
the genetics of sexual dimorphism, using experi-
mental, genetic and genomic techniques (https://-
immonenelina.wordpress.com, http://www.ieg.uu.se/-
evolutionary-biology/immonen/).
A co-supervisor to the candidate will be Prof. Hans
Ellegren, whose group studies many key questions in
evolutionary biology including the evolution of genetic
diversity, using genomic and bioinformatics approaches
(http://www.ieg.uu.se/evolutionary-biology/ellegren/).
To be eligible for the PhD-student position the appli-
cant must hold a master degree (or equivalent) in evolu-
tionary biology, genetics, genomics, ecology, behavioral
ecology, or other relevant eld. The candidate must also
be uent in both spoken and written English.
Experience in conducting laboratory experiments in in-
sects, molecular laboratory and bioinformatics skills,
and in-depth knowledge in sexual selection theories are
desirable.
We are looking for a highly motivated student, and
in addition to scientic skills within the subject area,
great emphasis will be placed on personal skills such as
communication and collaboration skills, ability to work
independently, scientic maturity and creativity.
Please see the full description, list of application require-
ments and how to apply here: http://www.uu.se/en/-

UStAndrews ComputationalBiology
PhD in Probabilistic Modelling of Evolutionary Trajec-
tories
Evolutionary biologists have long been interested in
the question how populations adapt to changing envi-
ronments. In experimental evolution studies replicate
populations are allowed to adapt to novel but controlled
laboratory environments. The evolved populations are
subjected to whole genome re-sequencing (Evolve and
Re-sequencing (ER) approach). These new experiments
not only use next generation sequencing (NGS) to mea-December 1, 2017 EvolDir 77
sure genomic features at one time point but also monitor
them changing over time with the aim of detecting signif-
icant frequency changes that indicate selection pressures.
Previous attempts at analysing data from experimen-
tal evolution studies have been limited as they could
not simultaneously include data at intermediate time
points, replicate experiments and sources of uncertainty
specic to NGS such as sequencing depth. In my group,
we have developed a Gaussian Process (GP) approach
to model the time-series data from evolutionary trajec-
tories measured during experimental evolution studies
(Topa et al., 2015) in Drosophila species. In this project,
we plan to combine the GP approach with population
genetic models to measure parameters such as selection
coecients and the population size. This will allow us
to improve the modelling evolutionary trajectories and
the understanding of evolutionary processes.
The PhD topic will also be open to modelling evolution-
ary trajectories for longer time-scales such populations
from dierent Drosophila species, or the development
of phylogenetic methods.
Candidates will be expected to have a strong interest in
applying quantitative methods and modelling to Biology.
They will have a degree in Bioinformatics, Mathematics,
Physics, Statistics, Computer Science or a related eld.
Prior experience with either population genetics or com-
parative genomics is a benet. Preferably the candidate
will have experience in programming language such as
C, C++, Java and a scripting language such as Python
or Perl.

Wisconsin FishPopulationGenomics
Master's position in the Larson Lab using genomics to
study connectivity and species diversity in the Board-
man River, MI
Description and responsibilities: The USGS Wiscon-
sin Cooperative Fishery Research Unit at UW-Stevens
Point is looking for a MS student to conduct genomics
research on sh populations from the Boardman River
near Traverse City, MI. This research is part of the
FishPass project, a large collaborative eort to explore
sh passage solutions that restore connectivity for na-
tive species while blocking invasive species, such as sea
lamprey. The Union Street dam on the Boardman River
is 150 years old, and sh populations below the dam
have been isolated from above dam populations since
its completion. The successful candidate will use restric-
tion site-associated (RAD) sequencing to collect genetic
data on ve sh species sampled above and below theDecember 1, 2017 EvolDir 81
Union Street Dam to determine if these populations are
signicantly dierentiated and/or show dierences in
diversity. Additionally, the student will collect eDNA
samples from existing monitoring sites and pair these
data with traditional surveys to determine the utility
of eDNA metabarcoding for investigating species diver-
sity and distribution patterns in this system. Genetic
samples from white sucker, smallmouth bass, walleye,
yellow perch, and rock bass as well as water samples
for the eDNA portion of this project are being collected
by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and
other local agencies and eldwork for the student will
be minimal. However, the student will likely be asked
to help with sample collection one to two times per
summer. Laboratory work will consist of constructing
RAD and amplicon sequencing libraries to send out for
high-throughput sequencing. Bioinformatic analysis will
involve using programs such as STACKS to analyze
RAD data and working with Linux based pipelines to
analyze eDNA data.Qualications: B.S. in biology, sheries, or a related
eld, GPA of 3.0+, and GRE of 300+. Background in
genetics is preferred but not required. Previous expe-
rience with eldwork and analysis of genomic data is
desirable.
Salary: $16,000 per year (2 yr) plus health insurance
and tuition waiver. Closing date: March 1, 2018.
Starting date: Position will start in September 2018 but
there may be an opportunity to work in the Larson Lab
during summer 2018 before the position starts.
Contact: Please send CV, transcript copies, GRE scores,
and names and contact information for 3 references to

disease processes, and evolutionary relationships. These
challenges are both multi-scale (with units of interest
ranging from molecules to communities of organisms)
and large-scale (data-intensive, in part due to advances
in sequencing technologies). Along with the Depart-
ment of Computer Science, CCMB is one of ve intel-
lectual units at Brown University that together round
out the broader landscape of research in methodologi-
cal development under Brown's Data Science Initiative

Precision medicine
The primary focus of the call is on computational and
statistical analysis of biological \big data", typically
produced by New Generation Sequencing (NGS) and
-omics technologies. Nevertheless, all modeling and com-
putational approaches addressing biological questions
closely related to the INCEPTION program areas are
eligible.
Successful candidates will possess the following qual-
ications: * Signicant achievements in bioinformat-
ics/biostatistics/biomathematics, * Broad experience in
methodological development and data analysis, * Rele-
vant publication record of cutting-edge research as se-
nior/rst author, * Demonstrated ability to collaborate
with experimental and computational biologists.

with 1.5 spacing, Times 11 font size). 4. The proposed
research project (up to 6 pages with 1.5 spacing, Times
11 font size) highlighting how it would t into the de-ned themes of the Inception program, and how it would
respond to interdisciplinary challenges of that program.
5. The names of 3 scientists from whom letters of rec-
ommendation can be sought, together with the names
of scientists with a potential conict of interest from
whom evaluations should not be requested.
The deadline for application submission is January 14,

Museum of Natural History (http://www.nrm.se) is
looking to ll a position as RESEARCH LEADER IN
COMPARATIVE INSECT BIOMICS Tasks The suc-
cessful candidate will lead a large, ve-year research
project in comparative insect biomics funded by the
Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation. The aim is to
use metabarcoding of Malaise trap and soil samples to
study the size, origins, structure and function of the in-
sect biomes in Sweden and on Madagascar. The project
is a collaboration between the Swedish Museum of Nat-
ural History (Fredrik Ronquist), the Swedish Univer-
sity of Agricultural Sciences (Tomas Roslin), Stockholm
University (Ayco Tack) and SciLifeLab / KTH Royal
Institute of Technology (Anders Andersson). The eld
campaign in Madagascar will be organized in collabora-
tion with the Madagascar Biodiversity Centrer (Brian
Fisher, California Academy of Sciences).
Together with the PIs, the successful candidate will be
expected to coordinate and lead all activities in the
project including eld work in Sweden and Madagascar,
high-throughput sequencing of the samples, bioinfor-
matics processing, research output, and public outreach.
The project sta will include eld assistants, lab techni-
cians, a full-time bioinformatician, and four postdocs.We also expect the project to attract additional guest
researchers and postdocs with external funding.

about the project and the lab.
Qualications We expect the successful candidate to
have a strong research background with a PhD degree
and at least some postdoc experience within a eld that
is relevant for the project. Ideally, the candidate would
have signicant experience of research in: (1) insect
ecology or systematics; (2) metabarcoding; and (3) com-
putational biology. The candidate should at least be
procient in one of these areas, and minimally have an
interest in and some previous exposure to the others.
Previous experience of project management or of the
design of eld campaigns is desirable.
The position can serve as a good platform for a future
research career in comparative insect biomics, in which
case we expect the candidate to take a leading role in
some of the research studies that will result from the
project. The position could also be appropriate for some-
one aiming at a future career in a research support role.
In either case, we expect a candidate with exceptional
organizational and communication skills, and with solid
leadership qualities. Expect that the coordination and
logistic challenges will take up a large part of the work-
ing time throughout the project but especially during
the rst years.
Fluency in spoken and written English is essential. Ide-
ally, the candidate would also have a working knowledge
of Swedish and French (for the Madagascar part).
Starting date. The starting date is July 1, 2018, and the
position is for 4.5 years with a possibility of prolongation
if additional funds for the project become available.

SpatialDataPostGIS
The MabLab at the University of Florida's Fort Laud-
erdale Research and Education Center (Davie, FL) is
looking to ll an immediate opening for the position of
a Biological Scientist. We are looking for an enthusias-
tic, highly motivated and responsible individual to join
an exciting research team focused on spatial ecology,
from ne-scale movement and habitat selection to range
dynamics. Candidate will be responsible of the data
system of the Lab (database, GIS and documents), and
will assist research and extension projects within the
Lab's themes.
The primary missions of the Biological Scientist will be:
1. Manage the Lab data system: the Lab relies on a
data server using Linux (Debian). Most notably, the
server runs a PostGIS database system, which hosts
data from research projects of the Lab (notably wood
stork, sea turtle and raccoon telemetry data and associ-
ated GIS layers), as well as Rstudio Server, Shiny, and
GitLab, among others. The candidate will entirely man-
age the server (keep the data base and the associated
metadata clean and up-to-date, set permissions for users
and groups, develop Shiny apps to access and display
data, etc.). 2. Assist and train other Lab members for
data processing and analysis: candidate will assist Lab
members (notably students) to process the data stored
in the Lab database system, in order to prepare them for
statistical analysis. He/she will also assist the next step
of statistical analysis when relevant. 3. Maintain and
develop the Lab R packages (basr, hab, rpostgis, rpost-
gisLT, ), and publish them on CRAN when appropriate.
Maintaining packages means keeping them up-to-date
with changes in R and package dependencies, while de-
veloping involves the integration of new functions or
the improvement of existing ones. 4. Contribute to the
Labs extension program, through extensive communi-cation with the Lab's partners (USGS, USFWS, ), the
preparation of brochures or posters, or the participation
in outreach events. 5. Participate in eld work: The
Lab and its partners periodically needs help in various
eld work projects in the area, in the Everglades or
beyond. The candidate will contribute to the eld work
eort whenever necessary. 6. Finally, signicant time
will be reserved for the candidate to conduct personal
projects, which can include side projects or overarching
issues within the Lab themes, and eventually lead to
peer-reviewed publications.

9.2m annually, the Institute's scientists deliver ground-
breaking research which spans the complete range of bio-
logical scales from genes and genetic regulation through
proteins, post-translational modication and cellular
function to whole organisms, populations and ecosys-
tems. The Institute has a strong prole in organismal
biology broadly dened to include evolution, ecology
and behaviour with an expanding portfolio of research
funding and the appointment of several new members
of sta in this area. IIB benets from state-of-the-art

computational biology and expertise in applying these
techniques to answer questions in evolution, ecology and
behaviour. Particular emphasis is placed on breaking
down disciplinary barriers and on encouraging the devel-opment of thematic networks of active research groups,
both within IIB, but also extending externally into en-
vironmental science, mathematics and veterinary and
clinical medicine. The Institute has Athena SWAN Gold
status in recognition of its activities and policies promot-
ing gender equality, placing it in the 1.6% of university
departments holding such an award (see ECU website).

REMINDER! DEADLINE: Monday 15 January 2018,
12.00 GMT.
**Godfrey Hewitt Mobility Award 2018 'V Call for Ap-
plications**
Godfrey Hewitt (1940-2013) was President of the Eu-
ropean Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB) from
1999-2001. He was exceptionally inuential in evolu-
tionary biology both through his research and through
his mentoring of young scientists. He was also a great
believer in seeing organisms in their environment rst-
hand and in exchanges of ideas between labs. Therefore,
ESEB has decided to oer, annually, mobility grants for
young scientists in his name.
Closing date: Monday 15 January 2018, 12.00 GMT.
*Eligibility: *
The award is open to PhD students or postdoctoral
scientists who are, at the closing date for applications,
both within 6 years of the start date of their PhD and
ESEB members. In addition, applicants will be consid-
ered who are more than 6 years from the start of their
PhD if they have had career breaks, worked part-time,
or for other reasons have not worked continuously. The
maximum single award will be 2000 Euros. It must be
used to support eldwork or a period of research at a
lab that you have not previously visited. There is no
restriction on the country of residence or nationality of
the applicant. A report will be required by 30 April
2019, by which time the funds must have been used.
*Application procedure: *
Your application should be sent as a single PDF le to
Ute Friedrich at the ESEB oce, oce@eseb.org. It
should include your name, current status and institution,
your PhD start date, your ESEB membership number,
a description of the work to be carried out (maximum
500 words), an outline budget with brief justication
(maximum 100 words) and a signed statement from your
PhD supervisor or postdoctoral adviser (maximum 100
words) explaining why the work cannot be funded from
your home institution or your proposed host institution.
Applications will be considered by a committee chaired
by Roger Butlin. The aim will be to announce deci-
sions before the end of March 2018. In previous rounds,
success rates have been between 20 and 40%.116 EvolDir December 1, 2017
The committee will consider the following key criteria:
1.The value of the proposed mobility in terms of its
expected output and impact on the applicant' ^As career.
The committee prefers projects that are: a. Not a core
component of the applicant' ^As existing PhD or postdoc-
toral project, but a new venture. b. Clearly based on
the applicant' ^As own initiative c. Likely to be completed
and have denable output within the award period d.
Have the potential to lead to larger future projects or to
enhance the applicant' ^As career in evolutionary biology
2. The need for the GHM award, i.e. the potential for
the funding provided by ESEB to make a dierence, in
relation to resources already available through the home
or host institution.
Please endeavour to address these points in your appli-
cation.

ESEB Progress Meetings
CallForProposals DeadlineDec12
****Progress meetings in evolutionary biology****
We are excited to announce a new initiative by the
European Society of Evolutionary Biology (ESEB), in
partnership with the Journal of Evolutionary Biology
(JEB).
We invite applications for funding to support focussed
conference or workshops on a topical issue where rapid
progress is currently being made in understanding Evolu-
tionary Biology. ESEB will supply funds up to ' ~A15,000
to assist with workshop planning (venue, travel or at-
tendance support). We encourage proposals on any
topic.
We expect these meetings to bring together a range of
researchers focussed around a topic for a \state of the
art" conference, ideally proposing a new synthesis, view-December 1, 2017 EvolDir 117
point or technical or analytical breakthrough facilitating
new avenues of research. Attendees would represent re-
searchers from all career stages and must accord with
our Equal Opportunities guidelines. Attendance should
be open to all, but ESEB members should be prioritised.
Typically, meetings would last 2-3 days.
A condition of the funding is that the meeting has a
clear objective to produce either a Special Issue or Tar-
get Review for JEB. Within 4 months of the meeting
manuscripts arising from the meeting should be submit-
ted to the journal, to be handled by the organisers as
guest editors or the editorial board of JEB, as appropri-
ate.
This is a new opportunity for a one-o topical meeting
for ESEB members and the evolutionary community.
There will be one round per year, with a deadline of *Dec
12h 2017*. Applicants should be members of ESEB or
our sister society, the Society for the Study of Evolution.
There is no ocial application form. The application
document should include
- The title of the conference and why this is suitable for
a Progress Meeting.
-Names and addresses of the organisers, with short (1
page each) CVs
- List of keynote speakers, with justication (potentially
key recent references). They should have agreed in
principle to participate
- A 2-page description of the aims and potential scope
of the conference
- Conference venue details
- Methods of selecting participants
- Publication plans
Applications should be submitted to oce@eseb.org

Dear Colleagues,I thought you may be interested in our AnAge database
of ageing and longevity in animals. We have recently
released build 14 with over 4,200 species and over 3,500
longevity records.
In addition to longevity records, which continue to be
our main focus and we make a great eort to verify their
authenticity, AnAge features one of the most compre-
hensive collections of quantitative life history data (age
at sexual maturity, litter (or clutch) size, adult body
weight, etc.) in vertebrates. Metabolism data is also
available for hundreds of species of birds and mammals.
AnAge is freely available online at: http://-
genomics.senescence.info/species/ We hope you will con-
tinue to nd this resource useful for your research. Com-
ments, suggestions and contributions are always appre-
ciated.

UF Department of Anthropology and AAAG President
Tuesday, November 14, 4-5pm ET Turlington 1208
Securing a teaching position is one of the most impor-
tant steps in an academic career, yet most PhD students
graduate with little knowledge of how to negotiate a
salary, laboratory start-up funds, oce and lab space,
and teaching responsibilities. These are critical compo-
nents to a successful academic position and valid points
of negotiation once you have been oered a position.
The webinar will focus on how to apply, interview, and
negotiate a position in order to ultimately build a suc-
cessful and mutually benecial partnership with your
institution. Participants are encouraged to come withDecember 1, 2017 EvolDir 119
questions about getting an academic position, as well
as questions about non-academic positions.
The webinar will be held at the University of Florida
and will be attended by in-person and online students.

phylogenetic network reconstruction Celine Scornavacca
University of Montpellier Wednesday, November 22,
2017, 9:00 AM PST
Several parsimony-based methods aiming at reconstruct-
ing explicit phylogenetic networks have been developed
in the last two decades. In the rst part of this talk I
will review several of these methods that share the same
underlying approach: First, combinatorial objects such
as phylogenetic trees, hierarchical clusters or trinets are
constructed from the data of the species under study;
Second, these combinatorial objects are combined into
an explicit phylogenetic network. The way they are com-
bined and the parameters to optimise (e.g. minimising
the hybridisation number, i.e. the number of reticula-
tions of the network, or the level, i.e. the maximum
number of reticulations in each biconnected component)give a large range of dierent problems, each of bio-
logical interest. In the second part of the talk I will
discuss dierent denitions of maximum parsimony for
phylogenetic networks, as well as the pros and cons of
each of them. Then I will introduce several algorithmic
results to lay the foundations for new parsimony-based
methods for phylogenetic network reconstruction.

Software PGT
Dear All,
I am releasing a new software PGT for plotting geo-
phylogenies (i.e., mapping a phylogenetic tree onto a
map):
http://dambe.bio.uottawa.ca/PGT/PGT.aspx It is
available for Windows, Macintosh and Linux (with Mono
installed/enabled). Here is the link for a screenshot of
PGT on Ubuntu:
http://dambe.bio.uottawa.ca/PGT/Ubuntu.png PGT
is extremely easy to use. It takes just a few clicks to
install. Start PGT, click 'File jOpen' to open a sample
le Banza.pgt which is in plain text. The rst part of
input le is a phylogenetic tree in Newick (or PHYLIP)
format and the second is a list of OTUs with associated
latitude and longitude. The last column is optional. If
used, it species which map symbol to use for which
OTU. The sample le Banza.pgt uses the same symbol
for the same species (i.e., dierent specimens from the
same species will have the symbol).
You can switch between regular and satellite maps, and
zoom in/out to any resolution. I bet that you will be
impressed by its user-friendliness and its quality. Enjoy!

tive for 2018-2019. As a member of the SSB Council,
you will have the opportunity to participate in the work-
ings of a society and interact with many of the great
researchers in the society. Student council members will
aid the society in developing initiatives to better serve
our student members, participate in council meetings to
provide input, and engage with student representatives
from other societies (e.g., the American Society of Nat-
uralists and the Society for the Study of Evolution) to
support joint activities, such as student-oriented events
at the Evolution meetings.
We are electing one representative for a 2-year term
beginning February 1, 2018. Student representatives
are expected to be active members of SSB (student
membership is $25), to attend the annual Evolution
meeting (travel costs and one night of accommodation
are covered by the society), and to serve on the council
for their full term (extension into postdoctoral work is
ne).

Systematics ResearchFund
The Councils of the Linnean Society (https://-
www.linnean.org/) and the Systematics Association
(http://www.systass.org/) jointly administer the Sys-
tematics Research Fund (SRF) that provides grants
annually for small-scale research projects in the eld of
systematics.
Typical activities supported include contributions to
eldwork expenditure, the purchase of scientic equip-
ment or expertise (e.g. buying time on analytical equip-
ment), specimen preparation (including the cost of tem-
porary technical assistance), and contributions to publi-
cation costs. However, please note that it is unable to
fund the cost of article publication charges. Projects of
a more general or educational nature will also be con-
sidered, provided that they include a strong systematics
component. Typical activities not supported include
attendance at scientic meetings and contributions to
student maintenance or tuition fees. The fund does
not provide payments for Bench Fees. Projects already
substantially funded by other bodies may be disadvan-
taged.Applications of all nationalities are welcome but
applicants must be a current member of the Systematics
Association or Linnean Society of London.
Successful projects are selected by a panel of systema-
tists who represent a wide range of conceptual interests
and taxonomic groups. Generally, applications in the
range of 500-1,000 are preferred, the value of any single
award will not exceed 1500.
Deadline 15 February 2018

Taxing Students
Evolution 2018 and Grad Student Taxation
Two pieces of information from SSB: One relates to
the upcoming Evolution 2018 meeting in Montpellier,
France [see separate posting in the EvolDir]: all talks
and posters must be accepted into a symposium, and ab-
stracts for these are due Jan. 15. This includes student
talks in the Mayr symposium. This policy is common for
ESEB meetings but unusual for SSB/ASN/SSE meet-
ings, so we are trying to call attention to it (please tell
your colleagues). Actual registration for the meeting
happens later (once decisions about talks and posters
have been announced). If you do not submit an abstract
by Jan. 15, 2018, you will not be giving a poster or
talk at Evolution 2018. The other is a letter by the
SSE, ASN, and SSB presidents about the eect of a pro-
posed US tax plan on students studying in the United
States. SSB has released other statements informing
the public about areas relating to our expertise, often
in conjunction with other scientic societies. See them
all at http://www.systbio.org/letters.html . Negative
Impacts of the Proposed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
We are writing as the presidents of the Society for the
Study of Evolution (2,674 members), the American So-
ciety of Naturalists (1,323 members), and the Society of
Systematic Biologists (700 members) to express signi-
cant concerns regarding the proposed Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act. If the deduction for qualied tuition and related
expenses is repealed, taxes will greatly increase for many
graduate students, such that such that pursuing a doc-
toral degree in the United States may no longer be nan-
cially feasible. As you may know, most PhD students in
the United States receive a small stipend, which is taxed
as income, to cover living expenses while conducting
research. Many also receive a tuition waiver in exchange
for working as a teaching assistant or research assistant.
If the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is passed, and students'
tuition is taxed, graduate students' tax burden will in-
crease by roughly 30 to 60 percent for students at public
universities, and 200 to 400 percent for students at pri-
vate universities, where tuition is typically much higher
[1]. This tax burden would be more than a third of a
student's salary at a private university. Such a changewould make pursuing a doctoral degree prohibitively
expensive for many students. Graduate students are
invaluable players in the eld of scientic research. Tax-
ing tuition will prevent many from nishing their work,
leaving their programs without a degree. Many more
will be prevented from entering into a doctoral program.
These changes would decimate advanced education in
the United States. To ensure the continuation of valu-
able research by graduate students across the country,
please preserve the deduction for qualied tuition and
related expenses. Sincerely, Sally Otto Society for the
Study of Evolution Kathleen Donohue American Society

Postdoctoral position in Conservation Genomics of
Freshwater Mollusks
The College of Agriculture's School of Fisheries, Aqua-
culture, and Aquatic Sciences at Auburn University isseeking candidates for the position of Postdoctoral Fel-
low in the area of conservation genomics. Potential start
date is January 15, 2018, but this is very exible.
RESPONSIBILITIES: This is a benet eligible, non-
tenure track position. The appointment is for an initial
period of one year, with a possibility of renewal up
to a maximum of a three year period depending on
performance and funding availability. The successful
candidate will be expected to design and conduct popu-
lation genomic studies using RAD-seq based approachesDecember 1, 2017 EvolDir 123
for sequencing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
Focal species include ve mussel species. The primary
objective of this research is to better understand genetic
diversity, population connectivity, and broad biogeo-
graphic patterns of threatened and endangered mussels
species. We are also interested in understanding genetic
diversity of captively reared mussels and snails com-
pared to natural broodstock populations. One goal of
this project is to use population genomic data to design
mollusk propagation protocols that ensure a reasonable
amount of genetic diversity in reintroduced populations.
Ultimately, the results of the study will be used to in-
form management and captive propagation protocols
for freshwater mollusks across the U.S.
The successful candidate will also be expected to gen-
erate peer-reviewed publications and contribute to the
writing of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service genetics man-
agement plans for study species. Depending on the can-
didate's interests, opportunities may exist for pursing
population genetic studies on other aquatic taxa (e.g.,
freshwater snails, sh, and craysh). This is a unique
opportunity to combine basic population genomics re-
search with applied management eorts of U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service.
QUALIFICATIONS: An earned Ph.D. from an accred-
ited institution in Biology, Genetics, or a related eld
by the position start date. Applicants should also have
experience generating SNP data, preferably for popula-
tion genetics studies, and bioinformatics experience for
analyzing such data. The successful candidate should be
able to work independently, possess excellent problem
solving skills, organizational abilities, be willing and
able to travel (including overnight trips), work outside
during summer months, possess excellent interpersonal
and written communication skills, and enjoy working
in diverse teams. Experience with freshwater mollusks
is preferred, but not required. However, the candidate
should have an interest in eldwork. Experience with
SNP data and bioinformatics will weigh heavier in the
hiring decision than experience with specic taxa. The
selected candidate must meet eligibility requirements to
work in the United States by the start date and continue
working legally for the proposed term of employment.
APPLICATION: Applicants must apply for
the position electronically through: http://-
aufacultypositions.peopleadmin.com/postings/2590 and
submit the following: 1) cover letter addressing the
candidate's experience pertinent to the responsibilities
of the position, 2) current curriculum vita, and 3)
copies of all graduate level academic transcripts. When
prompted during the on-line application process, please
provide names, phone numbers and email addresses
of three professional references. Only completeapplication materials will be considered. Active review
of applications will begin December 1, 2017, but the
search will continue until the position is lled. Salary
will be commensurate with education and experience.

and state governments. AWI focuses on polar and ma-
rine research in a variety of disciplines such as biology,
oceanography, geology, geochemistry and geophysics.
Researchers at the AWI Wadden Sea Station Sylt in-
vestigate changes to biological processes and coastal
areas due to anthropogenic climate change. Ecological
and evolutionary eects in conjunction with ecosystem
consequences are the main research foci of the working
group `Community and evolutionary ecology?.124 EvolDir December 1, 2017
The section ?Coastal Ecology? at the Wadden Sea
Station Sylt invites applications for a Postdoctoral Re-
searcher (Post Doc): (100% position).
Theme: Epigenetics underlying transgenerational plas-
ticity in stickleback
Background: Transgenerational plasticity (TGP) gener-
ated by epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation
can provide a temporal buer for genetic adaptation
of populations facing rapid climate change. We will
use populations of a marine model species (threespine
stickleback) to identify epigenetic signatures potentially
underlying TGP seen at the phenotypic level (physiol-
ogy and growth) in response to ocean warming, and to
disentangle the relative contributions of genetic and epi-
genetic change to adaptive potential along a latitudinal
gradient from the North Sea to the Arctic.
Tasks: We are looking for an enthusiastic, self-motivated
and well-organised person to participate in ongoing and
new projects where strong bioinformatics expertise is
needed. The main project will investigate DNA methy-
lation underlying TGP, but also includes analyses of
transcriptome data as well as neutral genetic/genomic
diversity of populations across large-scale environmen-
tal gradients. Participation in experiments and eld
sampling to obtain the genetic material is encouraged.
Requirements: - PhD in biology, bioinformatics or re-
lated eld - practical experience with standard molecular
genetic techniques and large scale NGS data analyses
tools (R, bioinformatics programs) - competence in com-
putational biology, population genetics and/or genome
assembly is an asset - excellent skills in English (spoken
and written) - willingness to participate in laboratory
and mesocosm experiments as well as eld sampling
campaigns in Norway - works well in a team - drivers

CornellU KelpStatisticalGenetics
Postdoc: Statistical Genetics of Sugar Kelp 'V Cornell
University
The position is in the lab of Jean-Luc Jannink, Sec-
tion of Plant Breeding and Genetics at Cornell, and is
part of a large ARPA-E grant to develop open-ocean
grown sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima). S. latissima is
a brown algae or kelp. It is phylogenetically distant from
both plants and animals, having diverged from green
algae early in the evolution of eukaryotes. The project
will explore its genome, the population history of New
England sugar kelp, and take advantage of its biphasic
lifecycle to rapidly domesticate it using cutting edge
genomic selection methods. The Jannink lab works with
several crop species (wheat, oat, barley, cassava, and
now kelp) to develop new genomic prediction methods
and integrate them optimally within breeding schemes.
These eorts source tools from genomics, quantitative,
statistical, and population genetics, and from machine
learning and operations research.
In research for this project the postdoc will collabo-
rate with scientists at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institute, the University of Connecticut, and the Hud-
sonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. Primary tasks
include the bioinformatic analysis of a large panel of rese-
quenced haploid kelp gametophytes to identify variants,
use the panel as an imputation reference population,
and estimate important population genetic parameters
of New England sugar kelp. Individuals from this panel
will be mated for evaluation by collaborators. The post-
doc will prepare and communicate mating and eld
designs for estimation of inbreeding depression and var-
ious quantitative genetic parameters. The postdoc will
analyze these experiments for genome wide association
and for training genomic prediction models. Data gener-
ated from the project will also enable research on linear
models to predict heterosis in breeding and the identi-
cation of evolutionary conservation and signatures of
selection in the sugar kelp genome.
Term is one year renewable to three years contingent on
performance.

MaxPlanck Germany Aposematism
We invite applications for a postdoctoral position to
join an exciting new research group studying the evolu-
tionary ecology of chemical defences, based at the Max
Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany.
Funding is for 2.5 years, with a possible extension of 2
years contingent on progress.
Background: Chemically defended organisms commu-
nicate their unprotability to potential predators with
conspicuous warning signals - aposematism. A protabil-
ity spectrum among chemically defended organisms may
be important in shaping ecological communities and
interactions among species. For example, variability in
chemical defences can switch the evolutionary dynam-
ics of signalling systems from mutualistic to parasitic,
from signal monomorphism to signal diversity. But
what constitutes unprotability, and how important is
it in shaping interactions among species? We investi-
gate these questions using a combination of laboratory
experiments and eld studies.
The postdoctoral researcher will be part of a team work-
ing in two systems: (i) laboratory experiments on the132 EvolDir December 1, 2017
link between warning colours and chemical defences will
investigate how organisms optimise their aposematic de-
fences; the project includes aspects of insect culturing,
characterization of aposematic traits, including their
costs (using biochemical, metabolic, spectroscopy, ma-
chine learning and imaging techniques), and ecacy
assays with predators; (ii) lab and eld experiments
on ecological pharmacodynamics will explore the mech-
anisms by which the chemical defences of prey have
their eect. The project will utilise techniques such
as working with specialist and generalist invertebrate
or vertebrate predators/consumers, toxicokinetics, iden-
tication and cloning of genes, quantitative real-time
RT-PCR, heterologous expression techniques, and bioin-
formatics procedures including comparative analyses.
Position details: Applicants should have a PhD in rele-
vant biological subject (e.g., biology, ecology, zoology,
biochemistry, or genetics) or related area, and a strong
background in evolutionary biology/ecology, chemical
ecology, or sensory biology (or any combination of those
elds). They should provide clear evidence of research
productivity, and of having been responsible for the
direction of their research.
Prociency in statistics and the use of R is particularly
encouraged.
The starting dates is negotiable, starting from March
2018 (but no later than July 2018). The working
language in the group is English (German skills are
not essential). Candidates should have prociency in
both written and spoken English. We are an inclusive
and diverse institute, and we encourage applications
from women, people with disabilities, and all under-
represented minority groups.
Location: The lab is based at the Max Planck
Institute for Chemical Ecology (MPI-CE), in Jena,

LanguageEvolutionPhylodynamics
The Transmission, Infection, Diversication & Evolu-
tion Group (TIDE) led by Denise K uhnert is oering
one PhD and one Postdoctoral position to begin on
01.06.2018.
The project:
The \phylodynamics" of language evolution
There is evidence of infectious diseases having had ma-
jor eects on the course of history, mostly by directly
diminishing population sizes or by causing people to ee
from disease. For example, the expansion of Austrone-
sian languages into Remote Oceania has been theorized
to have been pushed by one of the plasmodia causing
malaria infection. Testing such theories requires both,
an understanding of the past pathogen dynamics and
the cultural and linguistic evolution. The eld of phy-
lolinguistics has so far mainly been using methods that
were developed for viruses or other pathogens.
The initial aim of this project is to develop, test and
employ mathematical concepts to describe the tree-
generating processes appropriate for language evolution.
They will be based on birth-death processes, which are
suitable to model language evolution as they can incor-
porate periods of constant growth or decline, stagnation,
but also bursts and extinction events.
This project will be performed in close collaboration
with the Department of Linguistic and Cultural Evolu-
tion, led by Professor Dr. Russell Gray.
Your tasks:
- Development of birth-death process based methods for
the reconstruction of language phylogenies in a Bayesian
framework. - Analysis of language families, such as the
Austronesian and Austroasiatic language families, to
test hypotheses about their origins and historic develop-
ment. - Test dependence of language diversication on
demographic dynamics and potential links to ancient
infectious disease outbreaks.
Your qualications:
- PhD position: o Master or equivalent in a quantitative
discipline such as Computational Biology, Mathematics,
Statistics, Computer Science, Physics.December 1, 2017 EvolDir 133
- Postdoc position: o Have or are about to obtain a
PhD degree in a quantitative discipline such as Com-
putational Biology, Mathematics, Statistics, Computer
Science, Physics. o Experience with phylogenetic meth-
ods o Strong research record
- Both: o Strong interest in language evolution o Expe-
rience in programming o Procient English skills
The overarching goal of the Max Planck Institute for

sequencing, language documentation, bioinformatics and
phylogeography.
We oer an interesting and responsible job in a compet-
itive, dynamic and stimulating international research
environment. The Postdoc position is for 2 years with
the possibility of extension. Remuneration will follow
the public service pay scale (TV oD), according to quali-
cation and experience. In addition, social benets are
paid according to the regulations of the Civil Service.

Quantitative genomics of root traits in pearl millet
Studies of the genetic basis of adaptation have, for a
long time, considered mainly above ground phenotype.
Genetic basis of root traits and how plants shape their
root microbial community only begin to be investigated
as adaptive traits.
Pearl millet is an important crop for food security es-
pecially in the semi-arid areas of the Sahel where other
crops tend to fail because of low rainfall and poor soil
conditions. We recently characterized the variability of
exudation (Ndour et al. 2017) and root growth (Passot
et al. 2016) in pearl millet. These results led us to
conduct a genetic association studies on a large panel
of inbred lines to identify genome regions controllingroot growth and exudation. We plan to expand this
research in a recently funded ANR project \Root traits
for adaptation of pearl millet to future climate in West
Africa" that targets root traits in pearl millet to enhance
water and nutrient acquisition, production stability in
changing climates, and concomitantly to increase global
food security.
The postdoctoral fellow will be in charge of the research
to identify and characterize genes controlling QTLs for
root growth and exudation in pearl millet.
Prole: * Ph.D. in biosciences, plant biology, bioin-
formatics or related elds * Experience in statistical
methods for evaluating eects of various treatments and
detection of QTL in mapping populations * Ability to
work independently and in a research team * Knowledge
of both written and spoken English
Location:
The postdoctoral fellow will be hosted at IRD Montpel-
lier (France). The IRD is the French public research
institute dedicated to research on international develop-
ment issues. With a permanent sta of over 2000, many
posted abroad, it develops interdisciplinary research
in partnership with university and research institutes
in developing countries to advance knowledge on sus-
tainable development issues such as neglected tropical
diseases, climate change, water resources or food secu-
rity. The IRD research centre in Montpellier host 300
scientists, postdocs and students. It provides dedicated
plant growth (greenhouses, growth chambers), imaging,
molecular & cell biology and bioinformatics platforms
with state-of-the-art equipment and experiences techni-
cal sta.
The position will be shared between the CERES and
DYNADIV teams of UMR DIADE (IRD/U. Mont-
pellier/Cirad). The CERES team brings together re-
searchers in plant physiology, functional genomics and
systems biology to study the genetic determinants of
root architecture and root-microbe interactions in two
cereals, pearl millet and rice (https://sites.google.com/-

The department of Animal Ecology at NIOO-KNAW
oers a position for a
Post-doc on Predicting the evolution of beak size
Project description: In a recent study (Bosse et al.,
2017, Science), we studied genetic dierentiation and ge-
nomic signatures of selection by comparing the genomes
of great tits (Parus major) from our Dutch long-term
study populations with those from a UK population.
Several genes that underlie beak size were found to
have been under recent selection in the UK population
but not in the Netherlands. This is concordant with
an observed phenotypic change in beak size and more
edglings raised by the genotype for longer bills in the
UK. We proposed human-induced natural selection as
the cause of selection on beak size, as eld data show
that UK birds with large beaks make more use of ar-
ticial feeders. Garden feeding has more recently also
become common in the Netherlands, therefore it is ex-pected that there will be directional selection on beak
size in Dutch great tits over the coming decades.
This project aims to predict the genetic and phenotypic
changes of beak size in Dutch great tits. The candi-
date is expected: (1) to identify the network of genes
shaping beak size and to understand how variation in
this network aects beak size phenotypes, and (2) to
measure and predict how selection favours certain beak
phenotypes over others. The combination of the two
may allow us to predict genetic and phenotypic changes
in beak size in the great tit. This research will include
bioinformatics (GWAS, RNA data, network analysis),
data collection and analysis (phenotype-tness associa-
tions) on our long-term eld data, as well as behavioural
observations on feeder use in our aviaries.
Requirements: We are looking for a candidate with a
PhD degree in molecular or evolutionary genetics or re-
lated areas, who is highly motivated and committed to
pursuing interdisciplinary research and with experience
with genomics and bioinformatics tools. Good commu-
nication skills in English (written and spoken) and the
ability to work in a team environment is essential as
this project is in close collaboration with other Dutch
and UK groups.
Appointment: This is a temporary appointment, ini-
tially for one year and upon satisfaction to be prolonged
for a maximum of three years total at the NIOO-KNAW
Animal Ecology Department (full time). Starting date
is 1 March 2018.
Salary: Salary depends on training and work experience.
The gross salary starts at Eur 3.111,- (scale 10.4) per
month to the maximum gross monthly salary of a full-
time appointment at Eur 4.048,- (scale 10.12) per month,

Applications are invited for a Postdoctoral Researcher
to join the Laboratory of Dr Levi Yant at the John
Innes Centre.
Background:
Our projects employ large scale population genomics,
but at the same time have explicitly phenotype-rst
orientations. In each case we aim to determine the ge-
netic basis and evolutionary repeatability of adaptation
to intense, quantiable selection pressures, both envi-
ronmental and intracellular. We do this by applying
population genomics to wild plant populations that have
evolved to overcome demonstrable hazards.
We currently focus on adaptation to genome duplication
as well as adaptation to highly challenging, quanti-
able environmental stressors in species ranging from
Arabidopsis arenosa, to Chamerion angustifolium, to
Mimulus guttatus and back throughout the Brassicaceae
to A. lyrata and A. thaliana.
See http://yant.jic.ac.uk/ for more.
The role:
Primary activities will include conducting large-scale
population genomic projects. This includes exhaustive
demographic and selection analyses of population ge-
nomic data. We require candidates who are not only
motivated to run with these objectives, but who can
also propose new creative project contributions. By the
end of your postdoctoral term with us, we expect you to
be able to, for example, begin your own group, bringing
along your project from our work together. We also
expect to engender the development of new directions
as a result of discoveries in our group that can spur
independent trajectories for your future research group.
The ideal candidate:
Applicants passionate about evolutionary genetics or
population genomics are encouraged to apply. The
successful candidate will possess a PhD and a strong
relevant publication history. They will also have good
knowledge of population genetics and demonstrable use
of computational methods in an evolutionary context.
The ideal candidate will have initiative, analytical skills,
and a drive to push forward on new problems in evo-
lutionary genomics as part of a highly collaborative
team.Additional information:
To apply for this role please include a covering letter
with your application explaining your specic motiva-
tions to join the Yant Lab, as well as some specic
description of your use of computational genomic or
population genetic methods. This is a required element

Post-Doctoral Fellow: Microbiome Dynamics and the
Evolution of Resistance to Amphibian Chytridiomycosis
Seoul National University, Korea
We are seeking to appoint a Post-Doctoral Fellow to
work on a continuing research project on the evolution
of resistance to amphibian chytridiomycosis.
Recent results from our laboratory suggest that Asian
amphibians have evolved resistance to chytrid fungal
pathogens and thus populations persist without present-
ing clinical signs of chytridiomycosis. However, pathogen
loads vary among populations depending on levels of
immunogenetic variation, inbreeding, and climatic fac-
tors. Furthermore, individuals with resistance alleles
may incur some life-history trade-os.
Our current research program examines how immuno-
genes regulate microbiota that are important in immune
defense and the maintenance of population structure of
Asian amphibian populations.
The Post-Doctoral Fellow will conduct genetic analy-
ses on major histocompatibility complex and neutral
marker variation, together with microbiome analyses
based on an extensive NGS dataset. She or he also
will have the opportunity to develop their own research
questions. The successful candidate will have ample
opportunities to interact with Korean colleagues and
with our international collaborators.
Experience in molecular biology with a strong interest
in evolution is desirable. Research will be conducted in
well-equipped, modern laboratory facilities.
Seoul National University is one of the leading universi-ties in Asia and ranks 35th internationally (QS World
University Rankings, 2017). The campus is set in a
mountain reserve on the outskirts of Seoul and oers
excellent opportunities for outdoor activities as well as
the full range of cultural activities of one of the most

UEdinburgh 2 ViralGenomeAnalysis
The Institute of Evolutionary Biology at the Univer-
sity of Edinburgh seeks to appoint two Postdoctoral
Researchers to work with Andrew Rambaut, develop-
ing computational and statistical approaches to viral
genome sequence analysis in real time during an out-
break or epidemic.
Background: In recent viral outbreaks of Ebola, MERS-
CoV and Zika, viral genome sequencing revealed critical
insights into the evolution and transmission of the virus,
oering tantalizing examples of the potential value of
this for future outbreak control eorts. To maximize
the utility of this information, it needs to be achieved
in real-time, providing virus genome data and action-
able analysis and interpretation within hours of patients
being sampled. The ARTIC project, funded by The
Wellcome Trust, will achieve this by producing a mobile
virus sequencing system, including statistically rigorous
analysis frameworks, to prepare for the next outbreak
and ensure that viral genome sequencing is positioned
to have full impact on the public health response.
The aim of the project is to create a sample-to-response
molecular epidemiology system for acute RNA virus
outbreaks in resource-limited locations. Based on the
Oxford Nanopore Technology's MinION portable se-
quencing platform, the system will include a 'lab-in-a-
suitcase' for virus isolation and sequencing, in-country
bioinformatics of MinION data, real-time phylodynamic
analysis, integration of epidemiological data, and in-
terpretation and visualization of the results to inform
public health responses. The position advertised here
will focus on the computational and statistical aspects of
the project including the development of phylodynamic
analyses of outbreaks capable of updating in real-time
as new data becomes available.
Candidates will have a PhD in a relevant eld (computa-150 EvolDir December 1, 2017
tional biology, computer science, mathematical biology
or statistics), experience of developing statistical models
of molecular epidemiology, phylodynamics and phylogog-
raphy, and/or demonstrable knowledge and experience
of software development, High Performance Computing,
and GPGPU development. The candidates will have a
track-record of publishing in peer-reviewed, academic
journals, excellent communication skills, and the ability
to deal with a variety of tasks to set deadlines. The
project will involve working with project team members
including virologists, bioinformaticians and epidemiolo-
gists to create an integrated, practical system for public
health emergencies.
The posts are full-time for 5 years.

University of Minnesota
Application deadline: February 1, 2018
Position start date: May-August 2018 (specic date
negotiable)
Rationale
Understanding and predicting the behavior of complexbiological systems requires a framework that can inte-
grate across levels of biological organization, can capture
nonlinear feedbacks in dynamical systems, and can incor-
porate and facilitate mechanistic understanding. This
is the challenge of the future of biology. Meeting this
challenge requires a multidisciplinary approach that re-
lies heavily on innovations in quantitative elds such as
mathematics, computer science, statistics, and engineer-
ing. It also requires strong integration (or re-integration)
of molecular biology with organismal biology. Meeting
the food, water, and energy needs of a growing human
population, while minimizing adverse impacts of habitat
alteration, climate change, invasive species, overexploita-
tion, and pollution on human health and ecological sys-
tems - operate at scales from molecules to ecosystems,
and there is a pressing need to develop the science that
can cross these scales. The University of Minnesota is
developing research and curricular initiatives focused on
addressing grand challenges, and this program is part
of CBS' contribution to the university-wide programs.
Program Aims
The overall aim of the Grand Challenges in Biology
(GCB) Postdoctoral Program is to stimulate synergistic
interactions between faculty and postdoctoral associates
interested in collaborating on multidisciplinary research
that addresses societally relevant problems. Postdoc-
toral projects are for two years (assuming satisfactory
progress toward research goals in year one). Postdoc-
toral associates will be encouraged to participate in
grant proposal development workshops and other profes-
sional development activities oered at UMN and CBS
and are permitted to serve as Principal Investigators
on grant proposals. While in residence, the postdoc-
toral associates will be expected to be visible members
of CBS, actively engaging with faculty, undergraduate-
and graduate students and contributing to furthering
the collaborative culture of CBS.

Positions are available for one postdoc and two MSc and
one Ph.D. positions to investigate the foraging ecology
and genetics of two cleaner sh species that forage on
parasitic lice attached to Atlantic salmon.
The postdoctoral position begins in May 2018 and is
funded for two years. The two MSc. positions begin in
January or May 2018 and are funded for two years. The
Ph.D. position begins in January or May 2018 and is
funded for four years.
The project is led by Professor Elizabeth Boulding (In-
tegrative Biology, U. Guelph) with co-investigator Pro-
fessor Emeritus Larry Schaeer (Animal Biosciences, U.
Guelph). Our industrial collaborators are led by Dr.
K.P. Ang of Kelly Cove Salmon Ltd. (KCS) a division of
Cooke Aquaculture Inc. (CAI). They include Dr. J.A.K.
Elliott, Dr. M. Herlin, F. Powell from KCS, and Dr. T.
M. Jonassen from Akvaplan-Niva, Norway.
The objective of this NSERC Strategic Project is to pro-
vide a sustainable and pedigreed source of cleaner sh
to reduce lice densities found on Atlantic salmon living
in marine sea cages in Eastern Canada. This project
will develop highly-repeatable methods of measuring the
functional responses of two proven cleaner shes: the
lumpsh (Cyclopterus lumpus) and the cunner (Tauto-
golabrus adspersus). An outcome of this project will
be a breeding program for lice-eating performance by
lumpsh and by cunners at two existing hatcheries op-
erated by CAI. It will also deepen our understanding
of the reciprocal evolution of early mutualisms between
facultative cleaner shes and their clients.
MSc. student position 1 (behavioural ecology of shes)
will help develop methods of predicting lice-cleaning
performance of cunners in marine sea cages from ob-
servations of their performance in indoor tanks. This
will involve comparing condition-dependent performance
among dierent families of cunners from dierent geo-
graphical regions that have been reared in a common
environment. Cunner lice-removal performance in ma-
rine sea cages will be assessed using video-footage and
by examining their stomach contents.
MSc student position 2 (molecular ecol-
ogy/bioinformatics) will help develop DNA markers
to estimate pedigrees for cleaner sh families spawnedin the hatcheries. This position will involve high
throughput DNA extraction, and bioinformatics using
a high-performance computer cluster. This research
will identify DNA markers that show larger than
expected amounts of genetic divergence among cunner
populations and among lumpsh populations from
dierent geographical areas.
Ph.D. student (applied evolution/behavioural ecology
of shes) will help develop methods of predicting lice-
cleaning performance of lumpsh in marine sea cages
from their performance in tanks. This will involve com-
paring condition-dependent performance among dier-
ent families of lumpsh from dierent geographical re-
gions that have been reared in a common environment.
Lumpsh lice-removal performance in marine sea cages
will be assessed using video-footage and by examining
their stomach contents. Relationships between tradi-
tional and DNA barcoding of stomach contents will be
compared for lumpsh and for cunners and used to de-
velop non-lethal methods of monitoring the prevalence
of lice in their diets. This may lead to a deeper under-
standing of environmental factors aecting facultative
lice-cleaning performance in the eld.
Postdoctoral fellow (with experience in sh applied evo-
lution/applied ethology/behavioural ecology) will help
the graduate students develop repeatable methods of
measuring posing and other co-operative behaviors by
client sh that facilitate parasite-removal by cleaner
shes. Their own project will involve assisting with
salmon lice tank challenges of pedigreed Atlantic salmon
and measuring posing rates near cleaner sh refuges. It
will also involve video-assisted eld observations of client
behavior near cleaner-sh refuges within marine sea
cages. The postdoc will be trained to estimate breeding
values for lice-cleaning performance by the cleaner sh
and for posing performance by their Atlantic salmon
clients. Creating a breeding nucleus containing only
cleaner sh and client sh with high breeding values for
performance traits would be predicted to increase the
reciprocal co-evolution of this mutualism in marine sea
cages.

Deadline to apply is 15.11.2017
Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Ancient DNA and Evo-
lutionary Genomics A two-year position as a postdoc-
toral research fellow in the eld of ancient DNA (aDNA)
and evolutionary genomics is available at the Centre for
Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis (CEES), Depart-
ment of Biosciences.
The Postdoctoral fellow will be part of a multi-
disciplinary, international team led by Dr Bastiaan Star,
working on the project Catching the Past: Discovering
the legacy of historic Atlantic cod exploitation using
ancient DNA funded by the Research Council of Nor-
way. The position is aliated with CEES, a former
national centre of excellence (CoE). Expected start date
is April 2018. No one can be appointed for more than
one Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at the University
of Oslo.
The University of Oslo is Norway' ^As oldest and high-
est rated institution of research and education with 28
000 students and 7000 employees. Its broad range of
academic disciplines and internationally esteemed re-
search communities make UiO an important contributor
to society. The Centre for Ecological and Evolution-
ary Synthesis (CEES) is a Centre of Excellence (CoE)
based at the Department of Biosciences, University of
Oslo. CEES combines a broad spectrum of disciplines
(population biology, genomics, statistics, mathematical
modelling) to foster the concept of ecology as a driving
force of evolution via selective processes, with a corre-
sponding inuence of evolutionary changes on ecology.
CEES has over 160 members (Professors (20), post-
docs/researchers (45), PhDs (25), Master' ^As students
(25) and technical and administrative sta) and many
guest researchers. The members represent 30 nation-
alities and constitute a vibrant and creative research
environment. CEES coordinate several international
networks. The budget = 150 million NOK (about 50externally funded research projects). CEES is chaired
by Professor Nils Chr. Stenseth.
Project description Humans have used the natural re-
sources of the oceans for thousands of years. The main
aim of this project is to investigate if the intensive, long-
term exploitation of Atlantic cod has aected its pan-
European population demography or has led to evolu-
tionary change. By extracting DNA from ancient sh re-
mains (up to 10,000 years old), we compare the genome-
wide data of specimens that predate extensive human
inuence to extensive modern reference databases com-
prising hundreds of individuals. In addition, we aim
to reconstruct the early origin of long-distance shing
trade by analysing material from dierent types of ar-
chaeological sites (representing centres of export and
import). By identifying the biological source popula-
tion of bones from a large number of import sites, we
will investigate the extent and range of early Viking
Age and medieval sh trade (see for instance http://-
www.pnas.org/content/114/34/9152.full). Knowledge
of the chronology of such long-distance trade yields
fundamental insights into historic exploitation patterns.
In this project, we have access to unique biological mate-
rial from dierent countries that will be analysed using
high-throughput, whole-genome sequencing approaches.
The successful applicant will join a multi-disciplinary,
international team that brings together experts from the
elds of biology, archaeology and zooarchaeology. The
research fellow' ^As main task will be the comparative
genomic analyses of hundreds of individually sequenced
ancient genomes. These data will be interpreted in close
dialog with project partners and archaeological sample
providers. The ideal candidate will make a major con-
tribution to the planned research, but may also develop
her/his own complementary lines of research that reect
the candidate's own expertise and interests, and that t
within the project's main goals. This project forms a col-
laboration between the CEES at the University of Oslo,
the Institute for Marine Research (IMR), University Mu-
seum of Bergen, University of Gothenburg, University
of Cambridge and the University of Copenhagen.
Requirements Applicants must hold a PhD-degree (or
other corresponding education equivalent to a Norwe-
gian doctoral degree) with a background within pop-
ulation genomics and/or evolutionary genomics. The
candidate should be able to document strong skills in
the analyses of genome-wide data using phylogenetic or
population genetic approaches. Experience with ancient
DNA, analytical or experimental, is a distinct advantage.
Applicants should have a strong publication record for
their career stage.
We seek a highly motivated, enthusiastic person withDecember 1, 2017 EvolDir 159

Post doc in Computational Genetics, Uppsala University
The Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbi-

year Post doc position in Computational Genetics. The
starting date is exible (any time during 2018). Review
of applications will start immediately and the position
will remain open until a suitable candidate has been
found.
The Post-doc will work with the Virginia lines - a
chicken population developed during a long-term (60
year) bi-directional, single-trait selection experiment.
The adaptive trait is highly polygenic and selection has
primarily acted on standing variants available at the
onset of selection. In-depth explorations of the adaptive
loci have revealed that most are complex with either
tightly linked adaptive variants, multiple segregating
haplotypes and/or interactions between loci. The ma-
jor focus of the Post-doc will be to further dissect the
genetic architecture of the adaptive trait in and model
its contributions to long-term adaptation and individ-
ual phenotypes. A newly developed dataset including
approximately 4000 phenotyped, pedigreed and indi-
vidually low-coverage sequenced individuals from a 19
generation deep advanced intercross line between the
divergently selected lines is available for this work.
The responsibilities in the Post-doc project includes stan-
dard bioinformatics work with short-read sequence data,
development of software and pipelines (in R) for hap-
lotyping, genotype imputation and linkage/association
analyses to explore the genome-wide genetic basis of the
adaptive trait in the deep intercross line. The Post-docDecember 1, 2017 EvolDir 161
will also be involved in work to develop and explore
ways to model and reveal how complex polygenic archi-
tectures contribute to long-term selection responses and
individual phenotypes.
Candidates for the position must have a Ph.D.
by time of employment. A suitable educational
background will likely include computational biol-
ogy/bioinformatics as part of, for example, PhD studies
or Post-doctoral work in human/animal/plant quantita-
tive/population/evolutionary genetics, systems biology
or equivalent. Interested candidates are encouraged to
submit a letter of interest explaining their motivation for
working on this project and suitability for the position.
This should be accompanied by a C.V. and a description
of relevant undergraduate and graduate projects that
the applicant has been involved in.
The letter of interest, or any questions about the po-
sition, should be directed to Prof. ~Arjan Carlborg,
Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology,
Uppsala University; orjan.carlborg@imbim.uu.se. Re-
view will begin as soon as received and continue until

Genomic architecture of adaptation
A postdoctoral position is available at the Institute of
Population Genetics, Vetmeduni Vienna (Austria). The
research focus of the Institute of Population Genetics is
on understanding the genetics of adaptation in sexual
organisms. This central question in evolutionary biology
is being tackled using up-to-date methods and a variety
of approaches, including experimental evolution, quanti-
tative genetics, functional genetics, empirical population
genetics, bioinformatics and statistics.
The successful candidate will be part of a team of sci-
entists studying adaptation of experimental Drosophila
populations, which are exposed to temperature stress.
She/he can build on several highly replicated Drosophila
populations that have evolved under various tempera-
ture regimes. With up to 15 replicate populations from
dierent founder populations evolving for more than
100 generations, we host one of the best data sets cur-
rently available for a genuinely outcrossing species. The
postdoc will integrate data from whole genome time-
series sequencing, RNA-Seq and targeted phenotyping
to understand the genetic architecture of adaptation to
a new thermal environment.
We are looking for candidates with good quantitative
training and experience in handling large data sets. A
background in population genetic data analysis and/or
quantitative genetics is a bonus, but not required. Ac-
tive contribution to y work during common garden
experiments is expected, as well as a keen interest in
linking the data to the biology of the y.
The position is available starting from Febru-
ary 2018, but the exact starting date is ne-
gotiable. The application should be emailed
to christian.schloetterer@vetmeduni.ac.at

Dear all,
we have the last 3 spots available for the course: \Ad-
vanced Python for biologists" and the registration dead-
line is next Friday (20th October; https://www.physalia-
courses.org/courses/course12/)
Dates: 13-17 November 2017
Where: Berlin (Germany)
Instructor: Dr. Martin Jones (founder, Python for Biolo-
gists; http://www.physalia-courses.org/instructors/t1/)
Overview
This course is aimed at people who already have a basic
knowledge of Python and are interested in using the
language to tackle larger problems. In it, we will look
in detail at the parts of the language which are particu-
larly useful in scientic programming, and at the tools
Python oers for making development faster and easier.
The course will use examples and exercises drawn from
various aspects of bioinformatics work. After complet-
ing the workshop, students should be in a position to
(1) take advantage of the advanced language features in
their own programs and (2) use appropriate tools when
developing software programs.
Who should attend
This course is aimed at researchers and technical workers
with a background in biology and a basic knowledge of
Python. The Advanced course is aimed at people who
want to develop bigger or more complicated programs in
Python, or to learn more about the language, or to ex-
plore dierent approaches (object-oriented, functional)
to programming. The material covered is very general
purpose and can be applied to any kind of problem.
Requirements
Students should have enough biological/bioinformatics
background to appreciate the examples and exercise
problems (i.e. they should know what a protein ac-
cession number, BLAST report, and FASTA sequence
is). They should also have basic Python experience
(the Introduction to Python for Biologists course will
full these requirements). Students should be familiar
with the use of lists, loops, functions and conditions in
Python and have written at least a few small programs
from scratch.

Mar19-23
Exploratory multivariate analysis and visualization of
genomic data
https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
course29/ Berlin, 19-23 March 2018
Instructors:
Dr. Sebastien Le (Agrocampus Ouest, FR)
Dr. Aubry Marc (University of Rennes1, FR)
Overview
This course is divided into two parts.
First, a detailed overview of the classical exploratory
methods conceived for multivariate data: Principal Com-
ponents Analysis, Correspondence Analysis, and Multi-
ple Correspondence Analysis. From a unied theoretical
framework, we will see how these methods are linked,
as well as their specicities in terms of interpretation,
due to the nature of the data they are dealing with.
From a practical point of view, we will see how they can
be applied to genomic data, and how they can be used
to obtain meaningful information. We will see notably,
how we can add supplementary information to get a
better understanding of the data.
Second, an overview of methods that handle multivari-
ate data, when variables are structured according to
groups: generalised canonical analysis, and Multiple
Factor Analysis. These methods are really useful when
dierent points of view on the same set of individuals
have to be compared. It is the case for instance, when
one has at his disposal gene expressions on the one hand,December 1, 2017 EvolDir 171
and chemical measures on the other hand.
The methods will be presented from a geometrical point
of view. The concepts of quality of representation, active
versus illustrative variables, automatic description of the
dimensions provided by the analyses will be discussed.
Format
Each day will include an introductory lecture with class
discussion of key concepts. The remainder of each day
will consist of practical hands-on sessions. These sessions
will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises
with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as
applying these skills on your own to complete individual
exercises. After and during each exercise, interpretation
of results will be discussed as a group. Computing will
be done using a combination of tools installed on the
attendees laptop computer and web resources accessed
via web browser.
Who should attend
Researchers who would like to investigate multivariate
and heterogenous data from an exploratory point of
view. Researchers who would like to invest in methods
capable of handling multi-block data, in the sense that
data are structured into groups of variables.

Squeezing biology out of statistics: Gene set and path-
way analysis in HT data
Berlin, 12-16 2018
https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-
course3/ Instructor: January Weiner (Sta scientist,
Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology)
Course summary
High throughput (HT) techniques such as transcrip-
tomics or metabolomics are of great signicance in many
areas of biology. However, the path from a boring list
of dierentially expressed genes to a biological under-
standing of the results is not straightforward.
This course oers computational techniques that go
beyond a simple technical or statistical analysis. It cov-
ers techniques for the analysis of gene set enrichments,
pathway analysis, gene ontologies, functional analysis
of metabolomic proling and making use of correlations
and coexpression networks. A prominent part of the
course will be devoted to data visualization and visual
data exploration.
The students will gain the ability to independently pro-
cess and analyse HT data sets, select the appropriateDecember 1, 2017 EvolDir 173
tools, functionally interpret the results as well as learn
the paradigms of computational biology and statistics
which will allow them to eciently communicate with
computational biologists.
\As an incentive, each student will receive a set of gene
expression proles for a dierent organism, and during
the course they will use these to generate species-specic
gene expression modules and test their utility. If we are
successfull, we will attempt a joint publication."
Course prerequisites
In general, the course is aimed at biologists who would
like to take their data analysis in their own hands. While
an aptitude for computational work is necessary, the
main goal of the course is the application of biological
and statistical knowledge to HT sets with as little eort
as necessary.
- basic computer skills (a rudimentary knowledge of pro-
gramming principles in any language is recommended,
but not mandatory) - basic understanding of statistics -
basic understanding of molecular techniques for gener-
ating high throughput data
The students should be comfortable with using a com-
puter and have at least a rudimentary understanding of
computer programming. However, no specic skills are
necessary; the students will learn basic R programming
in this course.
Basic skills in statistics are necessary. The students
should understand the concepts of statistical hypothesis
testing and p-values. However, an in-depth introduction
to these concepts will also be provided.
Target student skills
- understanding of computational problems associ-
ated with high- throughput data analysis - statistical
problems and solutions in functional analysis of HT
data - overview of commonly used functional analy-
sis techniques (GSEA, gene ontologies, MSigDB, tmod,
metabolic proling) - multivariate techniques and ma-
chine learning - Communication skills in statistics and
computational biology
After the course, the student should be able to pre-
pare, analyse and functionally interpret a HT data set,
including multivariate and machine learning techniques.
Course scheme
On each day, the course will consist of four parts:
- Lecture: theoretical introduction to the days focus -
Hands-on guide: guided practical session in R where
students replicate the analysis performed by the teacher.
While the lecture is general, here specic R techniques
and R packages are introduced - Guided self-study: stu-dents are given excercises and problems to solve and
work on them individually under the guidance of the
teacher - Individual project work: each student will
receive a transcriptomic (RNASeq or microarray) data
set to analyse throughout the course - Lecture: wrap-up
and side notes; preparation for the following day
Course plan
- Day 1: Introduction to statistical reasoning and R -
Lecture: \Statistics gone wrong: basics of statistical
problems in HT applications" - Hands-on guide: work-
ing with R: rst steps - Guided self-study: using R for
data loading and basic statistical calculations - Individ-
ual project work: loading data for the individual project
- Lecture: \So you have a list of thousand gene names:
why do we do HT analyses?"
- Day 2: Data preparation and a functional analysis
primer - Lecture: \Methods of pathway and functional
analysis in gene set enrichment analyses" - Hands-on

Dear all,
We are happy to announce that the 3rd edition of our
course \Introduction to Linux and workows for biolo-
gists" will be held in Berlin (Germany) from the 12th
to the 16th of March 2018.
https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/-

attendees will be seated on a rst-come, rst-served
basis.
Instructor:
Dr Martin Jones (Founder, Python for biologists) http:/-
/www.physalia-courses.org/instructors/t1/ Overview
Most high-throughput bioinformatics work these days
takes place on the Linux command line. The programs
which do the majority of the computational heavy lifting
genome assemblers, read mappers, and annotation tools
are designed to work best when used with a command-
line interface. Because the command line can be an
intimidating environment, many biologists learn the
bare minimum needed to get their analysis tools work-
ing. This means that they miss out on the power of
Linux to customize their environment and automate
many parts of the bioinformatics workow. This course
will introduce the Linux command line environment
from scratch and teach students how to make the most
of its tools to achieve a high level of productivity when
working with biological data.
Intended audience
This course is aimed at researchers and technical work-
ers with a background in biology who want to learn
to use the Linux operating system and the command
line environment. No previous experience of Linux is
required.

increase in the availability of genetic data, have revo-December 1, 2017 EvolDir 175
lutionized the eld of phylogenetics. While genomic
data promise unprecedented insights into the evolution
of the tree of life, they also pose new challenges that
must be addressed to avoid misleading results and to
fully leverage the potential of the genome-scale data
sets. These challenges include the identication of or-
thologuous sequences that are suitable as phylogenetic
markers, the selection of appropriate models of sequence
evolution, and the detection of gene-tree discordance
due to incomplete lineage sorting and introgression. In
this workshop I will present theory and exercises to infer
time-calibrated phylogenies from multi-locus, RADseq,
and whole-genome data sets while accounting for these
confounding factors.
|{
Format
The course will be delivered over the course of ve days.
Each day will include an introductory lecture with class
discussion of key concepts. The remainder of each day
will consist of practical hands-on sessions. These sessions
will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises
with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as
applying these skills on your own to complete individual
exercises. After and during each exercise, interpretation
of results will be discussed as a group. Computing will
be done using tools installed on the attendees laptop
computer.
|{
Who should attend
This workshop is aimed at researchers, PhD or postdoc
level planning to infer phylogenetic relationships and
divergence times from multi-locus, RADseq, or whole-
genome data.
Attendents should have basic knowledge of UNIX and
will need to use the command line on their laptops.
Familiarity with a scripting language such as Ruby,
Python, or Perl will be helpful but is not required.

Topic:
Reduced representation genome sequencing (RADseq)
data analysis for population genetics, association studies
and phylogenetics
|{
Overview
Reduced representation genome sequencing methods
are revolutionizing evolutionary analyses of non-model
organisms. Several data generation and data analysis
protocols have been developed to generate thousands of
sequence variants in hundreds of individuals at relative
low cost and speed. In this course, we will introduce
the dierent approaches for obtaining reduced represen-
tation genome sequencing data and will specially focus
on the data analysis. We will cover all necessary steps
to obtain genome variants from short read data that are
informative for population genetics, phylogenetic and
association studies.
|{
Format
The course will be delivered over the course of ve days.
Each day will include an introductory lecture with class
discussion of key concepts. The remainder of each day
will consist of practical hands-on sessions. These sessions

http://www.physalia-courses.org/courses/course11/ In-
structors:
Brian Haas (Senior Computational Biologist at the
Broad Institute)
Dr. Nicolas Delhomme (Ume ~A ¥Plant Science Center,
Sweden)
Course Overview:
RNA-Seq technology has been transformative in our abil-
ity to explore gene content and gene expression in all
realms of biology, and de novo transcriptome assemblyhas enabled opportunities to expand transcriptome anal-
ysis to non-model organisms. This workshop provides
an overview of modern applications of transcriptome
sequencing and popular tools and algorithms for explor-
ing transcript reconstruction and expression analysis
in a genome-free manner, leveraging the Trinity soft-
ware and analysis framework. Attendees will perform
quality assessment of Illumina RNA-Seq data, assem-
ble a transcriptome using Trinity, quantify transcript
expression, leverage Bioconductor tools for dierential
expression analysis, and apply Trinotate to functionally
annotate transcripts. Additional methods will be ex-
plored for characterizing the assembled transcriptome
and revealing biological ndings.
Intended Audience:
This workshop is aimed primarily at biologist researchers
that have basic bioinformatics skills and are pursuing
RNA-Seq projects in non-model organisms. Attendees
will gain skills needed to successfully approach tran-
scriptome sequencing, de novo transcriptome assembly,
expression analysis, and functional annotation as applied
to organisms lacking a high quality reference genome
sequence. Attendees are also invited to bring a subset
of their own data. .
Teaching format:
The workshop will be delivered over the course of four
and a half days, with each session entailing lectures
followed by practical hands-on sessions. Most all com-
puting will be done on the cloud and attendees will use
their own laptop computers with the Google Chrome
web browser providing all the necessary interfaces to
the cloud computing environment, including the linux
command terminal.
Assumed background for the participants:
Basic experience with linux command-line execution and
execution of bioinformatics tools would be helpful. We

Erasmus Mundus Master Program in Evolutionary Bi-
ology (MEME)
MEME is a two-year research oriented master program
for talented and motivated students who are interested
in understanding evolution in all its facets. It intends to
provide an optimal preparation for subsequent doctoral
studies and eventually a career in academic research.
The MEME program addresses the driving forces of
evolution at all levels of organismal organization (from
cells and individuals to populations and ecosystems),
and allows students to study all kinds of organisms (mi-
croorganisms, plants, animals) in all kinds of habitats
(marine as well as terrestrial) with a diversity of ap-
proaches (eld, lab, theory). The focus of the program178 EvolDir December 1, 2017
is not only on how evolution shaped life on our planet in
the past, but also on how understanding the principles
underlying evolution can provide new insights and help
to cope with present-day challenges in a variety of elds,
including ecology, epidemiology, physiology, immunol-
ogy, genetics/genomics, bioinformatics, economics and
the social sciences.
To oer a program of such broad scope, four Euro-
pean universities (University of Groningen, Netherlands;
University of Montpellier, France; Ludwig Maximilians
University of Munich, Germany; Uppsala University,
Sweden), have joined forces with Harvard University
(USA). Together, this consortium has put together an
attractive multidisciplinary program that meets high-
est standards. All students have to study at (at least)
two partner universities, and they will receive a double
degree from two partner universities they have attended.
A limited number of full scholarships is available for
European and non-European students and these will
be awarded in a selective procedure. Details on the
program and the selection procedure can be found on
www.evobio.eu . Starting date: 1 September 2018
Application deadline: 1 February 2018
Please alert your students to this great opportunity!

NIMBioS UTennessee Selection
Jun18-22
The National Institute for Mathematical and Biological
Synthesis (NIMBioS) is now accepting applications for
its Tutorial, The Search for Selection, to be held June
18-22, 2018, at NIMBioS.
Objectives: Biologists are obsessed (indeed, seduced) by
the search for signatures of selection in organismal fea-
tures of interest, ranging from specic traits to genome-
wide signatures. A vast number of approaches have
been suggested in this search for selection, including
genomic-based signatures of recent or ongoing selection,
tests based on either excessive amounts or nonrandom
patterns of divergence (in both fossil sequences and
functional genomics data) and the more classical Lande-
Arnold tness estimates (direct association of pheno-
typic values with tness estimates) and their modern
extensions (such as aster models). Given the breadth
of such searches, a large amount of machinery has been
developed, but is rarely presented in a unied fashion.
This tutorial presents an integrated overview of all these
approaches, highlighting common themes and divergent
assumptions.
The goal of this tutorial is to expose investigators from
all branches of biology to this rich menagerie of tests.
It is applicable for population geneticists, genome biolo-
gists, evolutionary ecologists, paleontologists, functional
morphologists, and just about any biologist who pon-
ders on how to formally demonstrate that a feature
(or features) of interest might have been shaped by
selection.
The intended audience is advanced graduate students,
postdocs, and faculty with an interest in searching
for targets of selection, be they particular genomic se-
quences or particular traits. Given the breadth of thisDecember 1, 2017 EvolDir 181
topic, we expect students from functional genomics,
population and evolutionary genetics, ecology, paleobi-
ology, functional morphology, and statistics (as well as
other elds). The background required is some basic
introduction to population and/or quantitative genetics.
Location: NIMBioS at the University of Tennessee,
Knoxville Organizer: Bruce Walsh, Ecology & Evolu-
tionary Biology, Univ. of Arizona For more information
about the tutorial and a link to the online application
form, go to http://www.nimbios.org/tutorials/selection
Participation in NIMBioS tutorials is by application
only. Individuals with a strong interest in the topic
are encouraged to apply, and successful applicants will
be notied within several weeks after the application
deadline. NIMBioS will cover lodging (5 nights) and
provide breakfast and lunch each day at NIMBioS. If
needed, limited nancial support for travel expenses is
available.
Application deadline: February 1, 2018 The National
Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis
(NIMBioS) (http://www.nimbios.org) brings together
researchers from around the world to collaborate across
disciplinary boundaries to investigate solutions to basic
and applied problems in the life sciences. NIMBioS is
sponsored by the National Science Foundation, with
additional support from The University of Tennessee,

Course description This course on Landscape Genetics
provides a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary train-
ing and provides an overview of the eld of landscape
genetics. The course caters to students in basic andapplied ecology, conservation and population genetics,
landscape ecology, evolutionary biology and conserva-
tion biology. A key objective of landscape genetics is to
study how landscape modication and habitat fragmen-
tation aect organism dispersal and gene ow across
the landscape. Landscape genetics requires highly in-
terdisciplinary specialized skills making intensive use of
technical population genetic skills and spatial analysis
tools (spatial statistics, GIS tools and remote sensing).
Landscape Genetics will be concurrently oered at mul-
tiple universities across the globe, giving students the
opportunity to learn from international experts and
work with peers from outside institutions. For students
who are not members of the participating institutions,
we are oering a web-based online course to reach a
broader audience. Each course meeting will start with
a live web-cast lecture (no special software required) by
an expert on the topic that introduces foundations and
methods and highlights points for discussion in local
seminar groups.
After breaking out into local course group discussion
(including a discussion group for online course students),
a web-based discussion across campuses will wrap up
the weekly topic. Students who are unable to make
it to live- cast of lectures can view taped lectures. In
addition, students can choose to participate in an op-
tional lab section using R and/or interdisciplinary group
term projects with web-based collaboration across in-
stitutions. The nal two options are provided to help
students develop analytical skills in Landscape Genetics.
Students who participate in group projects will have the
option of applying to attend a project synthesis meeting
in Coeur d' ^AAlene, Idaho in May 2018.

WORKSHOP INVITATION
*INTERPLAY BETWEEN PARENTAL CARE AND
SEXUAL SELECTION*
Dear Colleagues,
We are glad to invite you to our Workshop that will
take place between 26th February and 3rd March 2018
in Fiskeb ackskil, Sweden.
We aim to bring together evolutionary biologists and
behavioral ecologists interested in dierent aspects of
the interplay between parental care and sexual selec-
tion. The main goal is to provide a relaxed atmosphere
where researchers with diverse backgrounds, at dier-
ent career stages, and that use dierent approaches
(from theoretical models to empirical data in a great
variety of organisms) can exchange ideas, discussing in
details the recent developments in the eld and propos-
ing future directions. We believe that addressing the
complexity of the interaction between parental care and
sexual selection from multiple viewpoints has a great
potential to optimize chances for breakthrough ideas.
Besides, the workshop will provide the perfect forum
for researchers (especially young scientists) to network
with other specialists in the eld.
The event will start with a reception on Monday 26th
February, will include 3 full days of talks from invited
speakers and attendees, 1 night of poster exhibition,
and a last full day of general discussion of relevant
sub-themes in the eld, conducted in small groups self-
organized by the participants. Talks will comprise 12
min of presentation, followed by a 13 min long discus-
sion session so that each participant will enjoy a total
of 25 min to interact with the specialist audience. In
particular, we ask participants to present results or ideas
from on-going research instead of already published pa-
pers, given that the main focus of the workshop is the
discussion of fresh perspectives and initiatives.
Conrmed invited speakers include:
Professor Suzanne H. Alonzo
University of California - Santa Cruz, USA
Dr. Lutz Fromhage
University of Jyv askyl a, FinlandProfessor Wolfgang Goymann
Max Planck Institute for Ornithology, Germany
Dr. Irja Ida Ratikainen
Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Nor-
way
Professor Nick Royle
University of Exeter, UK
The Workshop will take place at the Lov en
Centre Kristineberg ( http://loven.gu.se/english/-
about theloven centre), a marine research station beau-
tifully located in Fiskeb ackskil, suitably secluded at
the mouth of the Gullmarn fjord, and easily accessi-
ble. Social events will include informal hangouts at
night, walks to explore the village, a farewell dinner
on Friday night, and the premiere exhibition of a docu-
mentary on male-only care, featuring emus, pipeshes,
midshipman shes, poison frogs and harvestmen ( http:/-
/www.rotatingplanet.com/animal dads.php).
There are no registration fees. Accommodation and
meals for 40 participants will be covered by the nancial
support of the Gothenburg Centre for Advanced Stud-
ies in Science & Technology *(GoCAS)* and the Royal
Swedish Academy of Sciences (*KVA).* Participants
will only be charged for the costs of their social events

1Sky4bKzrxF4ImwrKCEcgdzFzLSjyhnWustoUELyyT8Q/edit
Background: Morphological identication of benthic
meiofauna and macrofauna samples is labor intensive,
time consuming, and costly. A more ecient method,
using DNA markers from metagenomic sequencing of
sediment samples to characterize benthic communities,
is being developed. For this purpose, a reference li-
brary for whole genomes of widely distributed infauna
species of the Gulf of Mexico is currently being popu-
lated. While still in its infancy, we are anticipating that
this new methodology will become a standard procedure
for ecological surveys and environmental monitoring pro-
cedures.
Purpose: The BITMaB-2 workshop is designed to train
graduate students and researchers in the full spectrum
involved in this new cutting edge methodology, includ-
ing sample preparation, taxonomy of common benthic
meiofauna and macrofauna taxa of the Gulf of Mex-
ico, metagenomics, and bioinformatics. There is no
registration fee for BITMaB-2.
Objectives: There are two objectives of this workshop.
First, we intend to produce meio- and macrofaunal spec-
imens from which we will generate draft genomes insupport of the development of the eukaryotic genomes
reference databases. We strive to include as many unique
families/phyla represented in the GoM as possible. A
complication for many groups is that fresh material will
be required to nd and identify individual specimens.
As such this workshop will focus on samples collected
each morning during the workshop from relatively shal-
low sediments. This aspect of the workshop will be led
by taxonomic experts and provide an opportunity for
training students, at all levels. The anticipated outcome
for this activity is to provide valuable experiences for
many students and to produce as many potential refer-
ence samples competent for genome sequencing analysis
as possible during the week. The taxonomy experience
will take place in the facilities at the Harte Research
Institute.

envelope models are dierent names for similar mecha-
nistic or correlative models, empirical or mathematical
approaches to the ecological niche of a species, where
dierent types of ecogeographical variables (environmen-
tal, topographical, human) are related with a species
physiological data or geographical locations, in order to
identify the factors limiting and dening the species' ^A
niche. ENMs have become popular due to the need for
eciency in the design and implementation of conserva-
tion management. The course will be mainly practical,
with some theoretical lectures. All modelling processes
and calculations will be performed with R, the free soft-
ware environment for statistical computing and graphics
(http://www.r-project.org/). Attendees will learn to

Course Overview: Spatial modelling is increasingly be-
ing used in ecology and evolutionary biology for both
basic and applied research questions. While emphasis
traditionally has been on species-level niche modelling,
the increasing availability of genomic and community-
level data has increased interest in modelling biodiversity
patterns above and below the species level. This 5-day
course will provide a thorough introduction to dierent
spatial modelling techniques for quantifying and visual-
izing patterns of biodiversity across scales of biological
organization - from population-level genetic variation, to
species ecological niches, to communities. Students will
learn about theory, common data types, and statistical
techniques used in these dierent applications.
The course will include introductory lectures, guided
computer coding in R, and exercises for the participants,
with an emphasis on visualization and reproducible
workows. All modelling and data manipulation will
be performed with R. Attendees will learn to use niche
modelling algorithms including Maxent, GLM, GAM,
and others, and will learn both new and existing meth-
ods for conducting comparative studies using ENMs in
the new ENMTools R package. |Generalized Dissimi-
larity Modelling (GDM) and Gradient Forest (GF) will
be taught for modelling genomic and community-level
data. The course is intended for intermediate R users
with interest in quantitative geographical ecology.
After successfully completing this course students will:
1) Understand the theory underlying ENMs and the
critical assumptions necessary to the modelling pro-
cess. 2) Be able to develop, evaluate, and apply ENMs
both in the context of conservation-oriented studies and
to study niche evolution. 3) Understand the statisti-
cal underpinnings of GDM and GF 4) Be able to de-
velop, evaluate and apply GDM and GF for quantifying
and mapping spatial genetic patterns and community-
level compositional variation 5) Assess population- and
community-level vulnerability to climate change

Reminder: Winter School of Bioinformatics for Adapta-
tion Genomics (B@G4 2018).
Registration closes 19.11.2017
For more information: http://www.adaptation.ethz.ch/-
education/bag-winter-school-2018.html Winter School -
Bioinformatics for Adaptation Genomics (B@G4 2018)192 EvolDir December 1, 2017
DATE: February 11-17, 2018
Given the positive experiences of the previous three
editions of the B@G Winter School that received en-
thusiastic feedback from both the instructors and the
students, we are happy to announce that the School will
take place again with a similar program and format.
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES The application of next-
generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to non-model
organisms is now well-established and has unlocked new
frontiers for research on adaptation genomics. Despite
recent technological developments enabling an increas-
ing number of projects to use genome-scale data, the
analysis of such complex data sets still raises substan-
tial hurdles for researchers with primarily a biological
background. Bioinformatic pipelines oer an invaluable
resource to process genomic data, but their underlying
rationale often remains hard to understand, which poses
signicant challenges for their rigorous use and for the
accurate interpretation of the results. The B@G Win-
ter School provides an opportunity for researchers to
penetrate the 'black box' behind the complex bioinfor-
matics approaches available for investigating adaptation
genomics throughout the analytical pipeline; from the
programs and assumptions necessary to produce a high-
quality SNP dataset to the in-depth interpretation of
methods designed to address key evolutionary questions.
B@G teachers are established scientists with a primary
role in the development of widely used bioinformatic
software, and will provide insights into the foundations
of the algorithms and suggest best practice in experi-
mental design and analysis.
AUDIENCE The School is primarily aimed at evolution-
ary biologists and bioinformaticians who want to gain
deeper knowledge on state-of-the-art methods used to de-
tect evolutionary patterns from genome-wide nucleotide
data. Applications from early career researchers (moti-
vated Master students, PhD and post-doctoral level), as
well as faculty with a background in ecology, genetics,
or bioinformatics, will be considered. The workshop is
particularly aimed at candidates with experience of the
Unix environment and with preliminary knowledge on
analytical pipelines for genomic data. Participants will
be requested to bring their own laptop with which to
connect to a server for the practical sessions. Classeswill include lectures on the theoretical background of
the programs and practical demonstrations given by the
instructor followed by hands-on exercises performed by
the participants under guided supervision.
VENUE The school will be hosted at the Alexan-
der & Gerbi Hotel in Weggis, Switzerland (http://-
www.alexander-gerbi.ch).
COST Total fee for participants is 750.- CHF. This in-
cludes tuition and accommodation in double rooms with
full board (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and coee breaks)
at the Alexander & Gerbi Hotel during the workshop. A
limited number of single rooms may be available upon
request at an additional fee of 300.- CHF.
REGISTRATION The workshop will be limited to 30
participants. We ask that all interested participants
submit a cover letter (1 page max) detailing their re-
search interests, their level of bioinformatics experience,
and motivation for attending the workshop, as well as
their CV (2 pages max) to BioinfAdapt@env.ethz.ch by
November 19th 2017. Participants will be notied of
the outcome of the selection process by December 4th
2017.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
