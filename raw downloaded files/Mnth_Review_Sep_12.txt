Dear Colleagues,
I am pleased to announce that on January 13-15, 2014,
the American Society of Naturalists will hold a confer-
ence at the Asilomar Conference Center, on the spectac-
ular Monterey peninsula in coastal California (http://-
www.visitasilomar.com). The conference is titled \Next
generation naturalists: new perspectives on integrating
evolution ecology and behavior".
The American Society of Naturalists is the oldest sci-
entic society in North America and is associated with
the journal The American Naturalist. The society's
goal is to advance and to diuse knowledge of organic
evolution and other broad biological principles so as
to enhance the conceptual unication of the biological
sciences. In keeping with this goal and the diverse sub-
ject matter in the American Naturalist, the Asilomar
conference will emphasize: 1) interdisciplinary research
spanning the areas of evolution, ecology, and behavior,
2) eective integration of theory, eld and lab exper-
imental research, and emerging genomic and bioinfor-
matic perspectives The conference will take on a unique
format in order to provide both a venue for presenting
your own research, as well as a setting for public discus-
sions to dene an intellectual agenda for our disciplines.
We hope that you will set aside the dates of January 13-
15 2014 to attend the Asilomar meeting. To be put on
a mailing list for future announcements regarding reg-
istration, conference format, and calls for symposium
proposals, please email amsocnaturalists@gmail.com

We would like to draw your attention to a two-day sym-
posium on evolutionary applications:
EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY AND THE MANAGE-
MENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS
22 - 23 November 2012 at the Swiss Federal Institute
of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag) in Duben-
dorf, Switzerland
Evolutionary and ecological processes occur over similar
timescales and aect the emergence, maintenance, and
change of biological diversity. The potential for rapid
evolutionary processes can also aect a broad range of
applied issues, such as the eects of invasive species, the
conservation of threatened species, the management of
aquatic pathogens or ecosystem services. We will dis-
cuss how approaches from evolutionary ecology can con-
tribute to solving environmental problems in aquatic
ecosystems. This is a science-stakeholder interaction
symposium that aims to foster collaboration betweenSeptember 1, 2012 EvolDir 3
researchers and practitioners. It comprises talks by in-
vited speakers, contributed talks, podium discussions
and a poster session.

Gordon Research Conference in Quantitative Genetics
and Genomics, Hotel Galvez, Galveston, TX February
17-22, 2013
Many diseases that aect humans, animals, and plants
are so-called complex traits, in that variation in sus-
ceptibility between individuals is aected by multiple
genetic and environmental factors. Thus, strategies to
understand and utilize the genetic basis and genetic
architecture of these traits rely on the application of
quantitative genetics. Traditionally built upon statis-
tical abstractions of genetic eects, the eld of quanti-
tative genetics is now rapidly advancing by making use
of the extensive and rapid developments in genetic and
genomic technologies to reveal explicit links between
genes and complex phenotypes. The eld of quanti-
tative genetics, therefore, serves as a focal point for
bringing together many existing and emerging areas
of genetics, genomics, physiology, epidemiology, statis-
tics, and computational biology. The strength and aim
of the Gordon Research Conference on \Quantitative
Genetics & Genomics" is that it brings leaders in the
elds of human genetics, plant and animal breeding
and genetics, and evolutionary genetics together in a
unique format that promotes an open exchange of ideas
and presentation of unpublished results on cutting edge
developments in the eld. In 2013, the Gordon Re-
search CONFERENCE will be preceded by a Gordon
Research SEMINAR, which will allow an unparalleled4 EvolDir September 1, 2012
opportunity for up and coming students and postdoc-
toral researchers to exchange ideas on the most cutting
edge science, gain experience presenting their work in
a high-prole setting, and interact with leaders in their
eld. The 2013 Conference and Seminar will focus on
many cutting-edge developments in the eld of quan-
titative genetics but with specic emphasis on the ge-
netics of complex disease, including whole genome and
next generation sequencing approaches to understand-
ing and exploiting genetic variation, to identify causal
genes and pathways, genome architecture and regula-
tion, systems genetics, host-pathogen interaction and
co-evolution, non-traditional forms of inheritance, and
statistical genetics and genomics.
Applications for the Gordon Research Conference must
be submitted by January 20, 2013. Please apply early,
as some meetings become oversubscribed before this
deadline.
********Gordon Research Seminar will be held Febru-
ary 16-17, 2013********
The Gordon Research Seminar is designed to provide
a stimulating venue for students and post-docs to dis-
cuss cutting-edge science and critical background in-
formation in the area of quantitative genetics and ge-
nomics. It is an ideal venue for presenting your work
and interacting with peers and leaders in the eld. At
the Gordon Research Seminar, we have space for 10
speakers and a total of 50 participants who will present
posters. Speakers will be chosen from submitted ab-
stracts. We are encouraging individuals interested in
speaking at the GRS to submit their abstracts by the
end of September. The formal deadline to submit an
application to the conference is January 19, 2013.
We have funds to cover registration and travel expenses.
Please apply early to eligible for these funds.

THEME AND SCOPE
The continuing advance of DNA sequencing technol-
ogy has produced an avalanche of genome sequence
and genome structural information across the evolu-
tionary spectrum. Transforming that information into
biological knowledge requires creative and innovative
new computational and statistical methods for compar-
ative genomics.
We solicit contributions on topics including comparison
of genome structure and organization, genome function,
and evolution. We particularly encourage contributions
that use new computational methods to acquire new
insight into biological processes. Advances in compu-
tational theory are also welcome.
Specic topics of interest include but are not limited
to:
. Gene and genome duplication . Gene family evolution
. Genome structural variation . Algorithms for compar-
ative genomics . Genome rearrangements . Ancestral
genome reconstruction . Multiple genome alignment
. Genome sequence comparison . Modeling genome
evolution . Comparative genomics for genome anno-
tation . Gene tree reconciliation . Species and gene
tree inference . Comparative metagenomics . Compar-
ative genomics linked to proteomics, metabolomics, and
other ~omic data . Comparative genomics and gene ex-
pression and regulation . Applications of comparative
genomic methods

Australian National University (ANU)
PhD Project with Research Support Phenotypic plas-
ticity & plant water use in a changing climate
This project will suit a student with interest and knowl-
edge in plant evolutionary ecology, environmental phys-
iology and/or ecological and evolutionary genetics
Although environmentally induced variation in pheno-
type (phenotypic plasticity) is ubiquitous, fundamental
questions remain poorly understood. E.g.: When is
plasticity adaptive? Which traits show such plastic-
ity? Does plasticity contribute to diversication? And
critically: How will plasticity aect plant response in a
changing climate? This project oers an exciting op-
portunity for a student to join a happy and productive
group at the ANU and to work with an international
collaborative team. The student will develop his/her
own project within the context of understanding the
adaptive value and importance of phenotypic plasticityin water use traits in a changing climate.
Suitable applicants need to be highly motivated with
strong academic and research backgrounds; skills in
plant evolutionary ecology, environmental physiology
and/or ecological and evolutionary genetics are re-
quired. Demonstrated ability to conduct eldwork,
and independent research experience are highly desir-
able. The project will apply techniques of environ-
mental plant physiology in eld, glasshouse and lab-
based studies. Interested students must apply for ad-
mission to ANU. Supervisors: Assoc Prof. (Future Fel-
low) Adrienne Nicotra, ANU in collaboration with Dr
Christina Richards (University of Southern Florida),
Prof. Fernando Valladares (CSIC, Spain), Prof. Mark
van Kleunen (University of Konstanz)
Location: The Division of Evolution, Ecology and Ge-
netics in the Research School of Biology, Australian Na-
tional University, Canberra, Australia will be the stu-

The evolutionary and diagnostic dilemma of cryptic
species
A PhD scholarship is available within the Biosecurity
Theme of the Bio-Protection Research Centre, Lin-
coln University, New Zealand for a candidate with a
strong interest in entomology and molecular biology,
good written and spoken English, plus enthusiasm to
travel and work as part of a multidisciplinary team of
scientists.
This project will be supervised by Karen Arm-
strong (Lincoln University), Tony Clarke & Mark
Schutze (Queensland University of Technology) and
Murray Cox (Massey University). Full funding
through a Tertiary Education Commission grant
to the Bio-Protection Research Centre, a New
Zealand National Centre of Research Excellence.
http://bioprotection.org.nz/research-categories/world-
leading-biosecurity BACKGROUND: Cryptic species
are biologically distinctive yet morphologically and
genetically indistinct, therefore presenting signicant
theoretical and practical challenges. Such species
question the current theories of evolution and biodi-
versity, but they simultaneously provide a valuable
opportunity to explore and develop those theories.
Where this concerns economically important pests,
they also challenge the dogma upon which successful
biosecurity and pest management systems rely on -
that target exotic or pest species can be accurately
distinguished from non-target species.
The sympatrically occurring fruit y species Bactro-
cera tryoni and B. neohumeralis are a classic exam-
ple of this, and have been a model system for cryptic
species research for fty years. Whilst almost identical
morphologically and appear genetically indistinct, they
are indisputably separate species isolated by mating at
dierent times of day. They are also biologically very
dierent, with B. tryoni a major invasive pest and B.10 EvolDir September 1, 2012
neohumeralis a non-invasive minor pest, thereby pre-
senting biosecurity agencies with a diagnostic dilemma.
RESEARCH PROGRAMME: Within the emerging
eld of ecogenomics, the student will explore the ge-
netic basis for the biological dierence between these
two species. Here the project sits amid several highly
topical areas of evolutionary theory, of which the exis-
tence of 'magic traits' in speciation, i.e. traits experi-
encing divergent selection that also happen to enhance
sexual isolation, is perhaps the 'hottest', but for which
there are few experimentally tested cases. The project
may also deliver new diagnostic markers for biosecu-
rity, and therefore has the potential to be of major in-
ternational interest on applied and fundamental science
fronts.
The student is anticipated to develop and utilise a com-
parative transcriptomics approach. Given these native
Australian species remain exotic to New Zealand, time
will be spent in Queensland, Australia to undertake
behavioural experiments, then in New Zealand to un-
dertake the molecular analysis at the Bio-Protection
Research Centre and develop skills in the bioinformatic
analysis of next generation sequence data under guid-
ance at Massey University.
Candidates should have a biological sciences degree
(2.1-1st) including subjects in entomology. Experience
with molecular lab work and/or bioinformatics is ad-
vantageous.
Closing date for applications is 3rd September
2012. Applicants should forward a letter of in-
terest and curriculum vitae including the names
and addresses of at least two referees by e-mail to
Karen.Armstrong@lincoln.ac.nz. The position will
start at the earliest possible date.

We are seeking a motivated PhD student to join our re-

the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in
Pl on, Germany.
We are looking for a highly motivated ecologist or evo-
lutionary biologist to join our group Community dy-
namics at the Max Planck institute for Evolutionary
Biology. The ideal candidate is fascinated by evolu-
tionary and ecological questions, independent and cre-
ative. She/he has a background in evolutionary biology,
population or community ecology and has worked with
aquatic systems before. A MSc (or equivalent) in Biol-
ogy is required.
Evolution in action has recently been recognized as an
important player for many ecological interactions. It
is now well recognized that evolutionary change can
aect the interaction between species within in a few
generations and that ecological interactions may inu-
ence the outcome of evolution in return. This project
uses fast growing aquatic organisms (algae, viruses, ro-
tifers) that allow tracking of evolutionary change and
ecological dynamics in combination with subsequent
analysis through mathematical modeling. For details
of the study system refer to Becks et al. 2012 Ecol-
ogy Letters, Ellner & Becks 2011 Theoretical Ecol-
ogy, Becks & Agrawal 2010 Nature. For more in-
formation on potential projects contact Lutz Becks
(lbecks@evolbio.mpg.de).
The institute oers a stimulating international envi-
ronment and an excellent infrastructure with access to
state-of-the-art techniques. The town of Pl on is in the
middle of the Schleswig-Holstein lake-district within
a very attractive and touristic environment near the
Baltic Sea, close to the university towns of L ubeck and
Kiel. Hamburg and L ubeck are the closest airports.
The position is funded for three years, starting as soon
as October 2012. We ask applicants to send a PDF
le containing their CV and letter of motivation as well
as contact information of two references by e-mail to

laboratory studies at the Max Planck Institute in
Seewiesen, Germany. Applicants will complete his/her
thesis being part of the behavioral neurobiology group,
department Gahr. http://orn.iwww.mpg.de/2542/-
Department Gahr Supervisor: Dr. Andries ter Maat
Tutor: Pietro D'Amelio
The project aims to clarify whether Zebra Finches are
able to recognize the unlearned contact calls by vo-
cal clues and whether these calls are necessary for pair
bonding maintenance.
Project description:
The Zebra Finches are one of the commonest study
model for research on vocal communication, mainly re-
garding song learning and production. However dy-
namics of call production and messages delivered still
remain to be unraveled. Our group aims to nd out
why and how calls are elicited within a social network.
The relationships within pairs represent an especially
salient aspect of the social system of Zebra Finches, a
socially monogamous species with long term pairing.
By employing behavioural analysis and correlating the
call production of dierent individuals we want to in-
vestigate whether the dierent call types are important
for pair bond maintenance and for advertising this to
all the other members of the group.
Using techniques developed in our group, the student
has to design experiments aiming to answer 2 questions:
a) Are Zebra Finches able to discern their mate's un-
learned contact calls on the basis of their acoustic fea-
tures?
b) Is calls production necessary for pair bond continu-
ity?
Students are encouraged to develop their own exper-
imental setting within the framework of the research
program.
Main Material and Methods:-Use of micro-cameras and backpack wireless micro-
phones.
-Video analysis (software: Observer 10.5)
-Audio analysis
-Use of statistical software (R)

Project title: \Red Queen dynamics in *Daphnia*; re-
vealing the evolutionary change in a parasite popula-

The PhD student will participate in a collaborative
research project of Justyna Wolinska to investigate
molecular signatures of host-parasite coevolution in
the wild. This project is a part of a large research
initiative funded by the German Science Foundation:
\Host-Parasite Coevolution - Rapid Reciprocal Adap-

this interdisciplinary research initiative is to use host-
parasite coevolution as a powerful and versatile model
for analysing the causes and processes of evolutionary
adaptation across scales: from genomes to ecosystems(see http://ieb.uni-muenster.de/spp/). Because of its
role as a driving force of adaptation and diversity, un-

challenge to evolutionary biology.
Specically, the student will screen wild populations of
*Daphnia* (host) for infections with a common proto-
zoan (microparasite). In the precursor project a) we
showed that this parasite is likely to induce evolution-
ary change in natural *Daphnia* populations (due to
its high virulence and strong genetic specicity for in-

within parasite populations) and 2) the spatial pat-
tern (across populations) using molecular approaches.
Importantly, 3) we will verify the results by applying
dierent genetic markers. Finally, we will look for 4)
molecular signatures of the genetic specicity of infec-
tion. The main molecular approach will be Next Gener-
ation Sequencing of some (polymorphic) genes of proto-
zoan microparasites. In addition, we plan on extending
the array of markers, by sequencing and analyzing the
genome of a target parasite. Alternatively, for the de-
velopment of new polymorphic markers, PCR ampli-
cation and Sanger sequencing of cloned fragments might
be used. Depending on the interest of the student, he /
she can be further involved in eld and / or experimen-
tal work. In summary, this project should shed light on
evolutionary changes in otherwise often omitted part-
ners in the host-parasite coevolutionary research: the
microparasites.
The ideal candidate should have a strong background in
evolutionary biology. In addition, knowledge of bioin-

year. In 2012, our cohort has been examining questions
linked to the genetic modication of mosquitoes and the
scientic, cultural and ethical ramications this topic
presents. Our student cohort entering in Fall 2013 will
focus on the problems presented in alleviating negative
impacts of invasive species on the biodiversity of island
ecosystems. What are the social, ethical, and ecologi-
cal consequences of current techniques and what would
be those associated with a genetically engineered ap-proach?
We are looking for excellent students who are inter-
ested in pursuing an interdisciplinary approach to their
graduate training. Students may have majored in hu-
manities, mathematics, or a social/natural science, and
should be seeking broad and rigorous graduate training
across these areas. We welcome students who have a
Masters degree specializing in one of these areas and
want strong interdisciplinary training at the doctoral

at Rennes University, France
Population Genetics and Evolution of partial asexual-
ity: Inferring and modelling the impacts of partial asex-
uality on population genomics
*Assumptions and questioning*
*~~~~~
The PhD student will tackle what are the quantitative
eects of partial asexuality on the expected genetic/-
omic diversity and its structure in metapopulations
when those ones undergo selective pressures and, DoSeptember 1, 2012 EvolDir 15
the joint eects of the evolutionary forces and partial
asexuality result in distinctive genomic patterns from
which biologists may infer the current and past evolu-
tion of such species.
The PhD student will answer by completing a popula-
tion genetics model dedicated to partially asexual or-
ganisms to take into account for selective processes and
by analysing a wide range of datasets and simulations
results. The mathematical model will allow to study
the evolutionary specicities and the genomic patterns
left by of such functioning, and to propose some infer-
ence methods. The model we use without selection has
already shown that evolution of the genetic diversity
of partially asexual species diverges the ones expected
from pure sexual and asexual species.
*The main prospective steps of the thesis*
*~~~~~
The work will consist in extending a mathematical
model by formalizing the selective processes applied on
genotypes. The model will become automated in op-
timized computation algorithms (in collaboration with
the Symbiosis team, IRISA, Rennes). The model out-
puts will be analyzed and confronted to simulation re-
sults, biological knowledge and experimental data (al-
ready acquiered in a wide range of organisms), the four
other partners of the ANR (the collaborative grant that
fund the PhD expenses) and a scientic network. The
PhD student will explore the trends of his/her quanti-
tative predictions, identify the specic eects of partial
asexuality on population genetics indices under selec-
tion and participate in providing new descriptive in-
dices adapted to such species (in collaboration with
S.Arnaud-Haond, Ifremer, Montpellier). She/He will
participate in the development of quantitative inference
methods to identify forces and eective rates of asexu-
ality under which genomes have evolved. Finally, the
PhD student will reinterpret the historical signicance
of asexuality in the evolutionary histories of varied or-
ganisms.
/Methodological and technical approaches considered/
-Running and developing mathematical population ge-
netics models (Markov chain, dierential equation, dif-

-Low level parallel computation, optimized compila-
tion, GPGPU.
-Analyses and interpretations of theoretical predic-
tions in population genomics and of already acquired
datasets (plants, algae, fungi, insects, coral, human de-

*Scientic and technical skills required by the candi-
date*

We are looking for highly motivated students with a
background in population genetics, applied mathemat-
ics or computer sciences. Applicants should have the
equivalent of a masters degree. The working languages
in the lab is English (French is a plus for social interac-
tions, courses will be oered by the lab if needed). The

UAntwerp EvolutionaryEcolBegging
The Faculty of Sciences of the University of Antwerp is
seeking to ll the following full-time (100 %) vacancy
in the Department of Biology-Ethology
PhD student by the University Research Fund (BOF)
in the area of Behavioural and Evolutionary Ecology
Job description You prepare a doctoral thesis in the
eld of Behavioral Ecology. The PhD project focuses on
the evolutionary ecology of begging at the interface be-
tween mechanisms and function/evolution using avian
model species (e.g. blue tits, gulls, starlings, canaries).
Begging, the solicitation of food from parents the o-
spring, has a direct and signicant eect on growth, sur-
vival, and thus ultimately on tness. Obviously, beg-
ging for food from parents should elicit the transfer of
resources, typically a greater amount than parents are
selected to provide, since parents and ospring are, at
least in birds, not genetically identical. Furthermore,
when ospring seeks parental investment, their begging
exerts a selective pressure on the parents. But begging
is at the same time also a target of selection, because it
is inuenced by the parental response. Both behaviours
should, therefore, ultimately become co-adapted. Beinga agent and a target of selection, begging follows a com-
plex evolutionary trajectory, avoured by evolutionary
conicts of interest. Possible lines of research are: -
To test important evolutionary ecological predictions in
the context of evolutionary conicts of interest, scram-
ble competition and the honest signalling of ospring
requirement - To impose (articial) selection on begging
(a) to investigate genetic covariances and correlated re-
sponses in traits that generate trade-os or that are
co-adapted and (b) to identify underlying control mech-
anisms via a correlated selection on physiological traits
- To study the regulating role of testosterone and cor-
ticosterone, since physiological mechanisms may aect
or even constrain the response to selection by linking
the expression of dierent traits across contexts or life-
history stages - To investigate what mechanisms make
begging adaptive and thus improve our understand-
ing of the evolutionary ecology of life- history traits
and tness components Prole and requirements You

astic, highly motivated student with a strong interest

UBourgogne AvianSexualSelection
*PhD PROPOSAL*
*Post-copulatory sexual selection in the houbara bus-
tard*
/A three year PhD position is available to work on a
collaborative project dealing with the post-copulatory
sexual selection in the houbara bustard./
In most animal species, females mate with multiple
males giving rise to the potential for sperm competition
and cryptic female choice. These post-copulatory com-
ponents of sexual selection add to those acting on males
to attract mates (pre-copulatory sexual selection).
Although the study of post-copulatory sexual selection
has ourished in the last decade, there are very few bi-
ological systems that are amenable to the experimental
study of sperm competition and cryptic choice.
Houbara bustards are endangered bird species living in
North Africa (/Chlamydotis undulata/), Middle East
and Central Asia (/Chlamydotis macqueeni/). In or-
der to restore and reinforce natural populations of
houbara in Middle East, the National Avian Research
Center (NARC) has promoted a captive breeding pro-
gram in Abu Dhabi (EAU) under the leadership of the
International Fund for Houbara Conservation. This
breeding program is based on the collection of sperm
which is subsequently used to articially inseminate fe-
males under standardized conditions (Saint Jalme et al.
1994). This allows investigating several aspects related
to sperm competition and cryptic choice, in a species
where both pre- and post-copulatory sexual selection is
supposed to be a strong selective force. Indeed, males
harbor extravagant sexual displays (Charg e et al. 2010,
2011; Preston et al. 2011) and females have been shown
to mate with multiple males in the wild, where the pro-
portion of clutches sired by multiple fathers is fairly
high (60%) (Lesobre et al. 2010).
In the rst stage of the PhD thesis, we expect to bettercharacterize sperm traits that determine the likelihood
to successfully fertilize eggs. Then, experimental work
could be conducted to explore the following questions:
1)Is there a trade-o between pre- and post-copulatory
components of sexual selection?
2)Is fertilization success mostly driven by sperm com-
petition or cryptic choice?
3)Is there a scope for sexual conict in this system?
In addition to their fundamental interest, the obtained
results could also be valuable with respect to the genetic
management of the captive breeding. On one hand, in-
seminating with a mix of semen could facilitate insem-
ination procedure by reducing the time spent to select
precise pedigree and by optimizing semen utilization
(mixture of small ejaculates that are usually discarded
could be easily used). On the other hand, sperm com-
petition might result in severely biased paternity with
a potential for strong involuntary selection acting on
breeding males.
This is a collaborative project involving the NARC
(Yves Hingrat, Loic Lesobre, Tony Chalah) where all
the experimental work will be carried out and where
the successful applicant will spend most of the time,
the French CNRS in Dijon (Gabriele Sorci) and the Mu-
seum of Natural History in Paris (Michel Saint Jalme).
Interested applicants should send a CV and
the name of three references to Gabriele Sorci
(gabriele.sorci@u-bourgogne.fr) and Michel Saint
Jalme (mstjalme@mnhn.fr).

food is provided by the NARC with no fees for the stu-
dent.

HostParasiteInteractions
The evolutionary ecology of biological rhythms in host-
parasite interactions
http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/-
biology/postgraduate/phdproj?tags=2&cw xml=-
projects institute.php#SReece 7 The discovery of
biological rhythms, such as circadian rhythms, in
parasite behaviours [1] and host immune responses
[2] suggests that timing matters for how hosts and
parasites interact with each other. However, to date,
the study of parasite biological rhythms has rarely
considered whether parasites are organising their
own schedules or whether parasites are passive and
scheduled by aspects of host physiology with circadian
rhythms. Furthermore, the study of circadian immune
responses has largely occurred without involving
disease or links to parasite behaviours. This project
will bridge this divide to investigate 'what roles do
the rhythms of hosts and parasites play in disease'
and 'what are the consequences for host-parasite co-
evolution'?
Specically, the project will use an established disease
model (rodent malaria [3-5]) to link parasite and host
biological rhythms to ask the following questions: (a)
What impact do circadian rhythms in immune factors
have on protecting the host from disease? (b) How do
host rhythms inuence how successfully parasites ex-
ploit their hosts and transmit to new hosts? (c) Have
parasites evolved time-keeping mechanisms to better
exploit host resources or to evade immune killing? (d)
Do the developmental schedules of parasites inuence
the outcome of competitive interactions between co-
infecting parasites?This project will synergise several disciplines across
biology including the systems biology of circadian
rhythms, behavioural and evolutionary ecology, evolu-
tionary immunology. The approach will begin by col-
lecting data from conducting experiments in the lab
[e.g. 1] to elucidate the daily schedules of host-parasite
interactions during infection. Depending on the stu-
dent's interests, the project could develop into focusing
on further experiments and/or could involve using com-
putational biology to undertake statistical inference of
disease processes [e.g. 6] to quantify the costs and ben-
ets of rhythms to hosts and parasites, and investigate
whether host rhythms drive the evolution of parasite
rhythms and vice-versa.

A signicant part of the functional diversity of life
on earth is thought to have evolved through multipleSeptember 1, 2012 EvolDir 21
bursts of adaptive speciation. The process of adap-
tive evolution is therefore central in the eld of evolu-
tionary biology and the understanding of the genetic
mechanisms underlying the evolution of adaptive traits
remains a challenging task.
This project is aimed at investigating the evolution of
genes that are involved in adaptive responses. The can-
didate will analyze the transcriptomes established in
our laboratory to identify and characterize genes in-
volved in the evolution of adaptive traits and to de-
termine whether particular biological processes are en-
riched in positively selected genes. The candidate will
establish correlations between the emergence of pos-
itively selected mutations and particular phenotypes.
The role played by lineage-specic positively selected
genes will also be assessed, in particular by the anal-
ysis of the expression pattern of non-annotated posi-
tively selected genes. To these aims, the candidate will
participate in the development of new combinations of
state-of-the-art techniques to obtain homologous DNA
sequences of interest in a large panel of closely related
species.
We will use as model organism the Loricariinae catsh
subfamily as it is highly diversied in terms of morphol-
ogy, ecology, behavior, and in number of species.
This project is founded by a Swiss National Science
Foundation (SNSF) grant.
The Department of Genetics and Evolution hosts re-
search groups working on regulation of vertebrate devel-
opment (Denis Duboule), articial and natural evolu-
tion (Michel Milinkovitch), molecular phylogeny of pro-
tists (Jan Pawlowski), developmental and molecular bi-
ology of sensory systems in mammals (Ivan Rodriguez),
development and regeneration in Hydra (Brigitte Gal-
liot), regulation of development in Drosophila (Fran cois
Karch), sex determination and early development in
Drosophila (Daniel Pauli).
Ideal candidates will have a Ms degree in biology with
a specialization in evolution, developmental genetics,
or phylogenetics, should be experienced in laboratory
techniques (e.g. DNA, RNA extraction, PCR and RT-
PCR, DNA sequencing, cDNA library, cloning, In Situ
Hybridization), with advanced skills in DNA sequence
analysis and in gene expression analysis. The position is
initially for three years. The selected candidate will be
enrolled in the doctoral program Ecology & Evolution
(http://biologie.cuso.ch/ecologie-evolution/welcome)
CLOSING DATE: Open until lled, but all application
materials, including CV, a summary of research expe-
rience, copies of relevant published or in-press papers,
and three reference persons should be received by 1st ofSeptember 2012 to ensure full consideration. The posi-

PhD Position in Evolutionary Genetics of Wildlife Dis-
ease University of Zurich, Switzerland
A 3-year PhD position is available in Barbara
Tschirren's group at the University of Zurich, Switzer-
land, to work on the genetic basis of Borrelia resistance
in natural rodent populations.
Lyme borreliosis is the most important zoonotic dis-
ease in Europe and North America, having major de-
bilitating eects in humans. It is caused by the spiro-
chete Borrelia sp., which is transmitted by ticks of the
Ixodes ricinus complex to animal hosts, in particular
small rodents. Natural hosts are commonly and heav-
ily infested with ticks throughout their life, and thus
encounter Borrelia on a regular basis. Yet, only about
20-30% of animals become Borrelia infected, demon-
strating that natural hosts have evolved powerful de-
fence mechanisms, which prevent and / or control Bor-
relia infection. To date, this variation in Borrelia resis-
tance remains poorly understood, which hampers fur-
ther progress in the management of this emerging pub-
lic health risk, as well as our understanding of coevolu-
tionary processes in host-Borrelia systems.
In this PhD project, as part of the University Research
Priority Program -Evolution in Action', we will com-
bine ecological research in natural rodent populations
with molecular work in the laboratory to obtain com-
prehensive insights into the genetic and regulatory basis
of variation in resistance to Borrelia in the wild.
Sequencing of candidate regions in animals from pop-
ulations, which dier in Borrelia prevalence (along al-
titudinal gradients in the Swiss Alps) will allow us to
investigate the role of parasites in population dieren-
tiation. Due to climate change, Borrelia now occurs in
Switzerland at altitudes that were previously Borrelia-
free. This provides a unique opportunity to investigate
changes in the genetic composition of host populations
that have no coevolutionary history with Borrelia, pro-
viding a powerful model to study rapid evolutionary
changes in response to emerging pathogens.
The ideal candidate for this project is fascinated by
evolutionary questions, highly motivated, independent
and creative, and has a strong interest to combine work
in the eld with molecular analyses in the lab. She /
he has a background in evolutionary ecology or molecu-24 EvolDir September 1, 2012
lar ecology (or a related eld) and some lab experience.
The project requires substantial amount of eldwork
under sometimes dicult conditions (terrain, weather)
for several weeks in the Swiss Alps. A driver's license
is required.
The successful applicant will be based at the Institute
of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies of
the University of Zurich, providing ample opportuni-
ties for collaborations and interactions with researchers
working in related and complementary elds (http://-
www.ieu.uzh.ch). The research groups are very inter-
national and the working language is English.
Applications should include 1) a cover letter outlining
your motivation to work on this project as well as your
relevant experience, 2) a detailed curriculum vitae, 3)
copies of academic qualications, 4) the contact details
of two academic referees, and 5) a 1/2-page description
of your MSc project. Send the above as a single .pdf

U Uppsala MossGenomics
PhD position in evolutionary functional genomics at
the department of Plant Ecology and Evolution, Evo-
lutionary Biology Centre, Uppsala University, Sweden^ a
Project description: In this project you will study
genome evolution of early land plants. While mosses
represent one of the rst groups of land plants, fossil
records as well as biogeographic distributions suggest
a very slow rate of morphological evolution. Based on
these observations, and that more than 90% of moss
species present at the end of the Tertiary seem to be
present today, mosses have been characterised as \un-
changing sphinxes of the past". The reasons for these
observations are unknown, but it has been suggested
that the evolutionary potential of bryophytes is limitedby a low rate of molecular evolution. A major part
of the project will be devoted to comparative studies
of a number of moss genomes to answer this question.
Other sub-projects are focused on the molecular evolu-
tion of specic mechanisms e.g., circadian clock mech-
anisms, the genetics of adaptation in early land plants,
and phylogenetic studies.
An important part of your work will include statisti-
cal and genome analyses of large DNA sequence data
sets from a number of moss genomes, most of which
have not been sequenced before. In addition, molecu-
lar and experimental studies of specic pathways and
phenotypic traits may be included. The exact work-
plan of the thesis will be settled together with the doc-
toral student. ^ a^ aThe PhD student will be based in
the group of Ulf Lagercrantz at the Evolutionary Bi-

We invite applicants as part of a major investment
by the University of Birmingham into Environmen-
tal Systems Biology. This interdisciplinary initiative
builds on existing strengths in environmental genomics,
metabolomics, organism physiology, computational bi-
ology and evolutionary ecology to understand molecule-
environment interactions in the context of individual
tness and population-level responses to a changing en-
vironment.
We are interested in knowing how natural populations
respond to environmental challenges that are driven by
pollution and climate change, across rapid, seasonal
and evolutionary timescales, with a particular focus
on the keystone freshwater species and NIH model or-
ganism Daphnia. We aim for a deep mechanistic un-
derstanding of acclimation and adaptive processes in
light of the organism's biology and ecological interac-
tions, facilitated in part through computational biol-
ogy. Our research leverages state-of-the-art ^ aomics and
computational facilities, including the national NERC
metabolomics facility and the newly announced Joint
BGI-Birmingham Environment and Health Initiative in
genomics and metabolomics (see press release: http:/-

rations, as well as contribute to the School's teaching
portfolio. While exceptional individuals from all rele-
vant disciplines are encouraged to apply, we particularly
seek applicants in these four areas:
1. Molecular Ecotoxicology - for example to inves-
tigate the molecular responses of organisms to com-
plex environmental exposures, at the genetic, epige-
netic, metabolic or physiological levels. 2. Molecu-
lar Animal Physiology - for example to investigate the
mechanistic basis of phenotypic plasticity; to determine
how energy and metabolic homeostasis is maintained in
uctuating environments; to examine the mechanistic
links between physiological stress tolerance and genetic
adaptation. 3. Chemical Ecology - for example to ex-
tend metabolomics from intra- organism studies to in-
vestigating the production and subsequent response to
chemical signalling molecules in the environment; to
discover how environmental challenges may impact on
organism- organism chemical communication. 4. Com-
putational Biology - for example to utilize network bi-
ology to investigate the mechanistic basis underlying
genomic, metabolomic, physiological and environmen-38 EvolDir September 1, 2012
tal interactions; to conduct genome-wide metabolic re-
constructions or genome/metabolome-wide association

RESEARCH ASSISTANT IN EVOLUTIONARY
ECOLOGY
A research assistant position is available to work with
Dr Rebecca Kilner in the Department of Zoology at
the University of Cambridge. The post is funded by
the ERC.
The research assistant will work on a project inves-
tigating whether parental care can drive evolutionary
change. Variation in the extent of parental care re-
ceived during development induces considerable pheno-
typic variation in subsequent adult life. The aim of
this project is to determine whether selection can act
on such developmentally induced plasticity and thereby
cause evolutionary change. We shall focus on burying
beetles Nicrophorus spp as our model experimental sys-
tem because we know from previous work that parent
beetles establish developmental conditions for their o-
spring that have a profound eect on morphological, be-
havioural and social traits subsequently shown in adult-
hood. The successful candidate will divide their time
between running large-scale experiments in the lab (in-
cluding selection experiments) at the Department of Zo-
ology and carrying out eldwork at sites around Cam-
bridgeshire.We are seeking a highly motivated, enthusiastic re-
searcher with at least a BSc in biological sciences (an
MPhil would be an advantage) and with a background
in evolutionary biology. Previous experience working
with insects or selection experiments would be an ad-
vantage. A driving licence is essential.
The post is available for up to ve years, with a proba-
ble start date of 1 November 2012. The starting salary
is$23,811 - $26,779 per annum. The post is currently
advertised on the website of the Zoology, Cambridge

UQueensland InsectPopGeneticist
Insect Population Genetics Post-Doc position at the
University of Queensland, Australia:
Globally, food security has become a major concern.
Stored grains suer severe losses, with insect pests of
major concern. Phosphine fumigant is the treatment
of choice against these pests because it is the cheap-
est and most benign compound environmentally and
leaves no residues on the food. Several major insect
pests have developed resistance to phosphine, and the
international collaboration of this project is dedicated
to understanding the ecological basis of phosphine re-
sistance and to developing suitable management strate-
gies. This position, based at The University of Queens-
land, will involve strong collaboration with colleagues
at the Queensland Department of Agriculture, Forestry
& Fisheries and colleagues at several institutions in
India. The research will involve population genetics
screening and analysis as well as ecological eldwork,
possibly also in India.
The Postdoctoral Fellow will work with pest manage-
ment specialists, molecular biologists and ecologists to
determine how phosphine resistance develops, increases
in frequency and spreads spatially, and how best to con-
tain it. This will include experimental manipulation of
populations to assess the role of migration and selection
on the fate of resistance genes.
This is a full-time xed term appointment at Academic
level A, until 31 March 2015. The remuneration pack-
age will be in the range of $70,677 - $75,868 pa plus
superannuation contributions of up to 17 %. (Total
package will be in the range of $82,692 - $88,766 pa).

Biochemistry phenoptosis
Call for papers To the Researchers in the biological
elds related to programmed death phenomena
A few days ago, a special issue of Biochemistry
(Moscow) dedicated to the phenomenon Phenoptosis
was published. The prestigious journal Biochemistry
(Moscow) is directed by Prof. Vladimir P. Skulachev
(http://www.belozersky.msu.ru/en/component/-
contact/contact/1-skulachev-v-p.html?allpapers=1)
and published in both Russian and English (http://-
www.springerlink.com/content/106282/?MUD=MP).
The aforesaid special issue is also freely available at
http://protein.bio.msu.ru/biokhimiya/contents/v77/-
ToC7707.html The magazine and its authoritative
Editor-in-Chief plan the publication of other special
issues devoted to the phenomenon phenoptosis and,
if possible, the creation of a new journal specically
devoted to this subject. Phenoptosis is dened \the
programmed death of an individual" [Skulachev, V.
P. (1999) Biochem. (Moscow) 64, 1418-1426] or, more
broadly, \the death of an individual caused by its own
actions or by actions of close relatives (siblicide; in
particular, the parent-caused death of an ospring or
lial infanticide) and not caused primarily by accidents
or diseases or external factors, which is determined,
regulated or inuenced by genes favoured by natural
selection. "[Libertini, G. (2012), Biochem. (Moscow)
77, 707-15].
A classication of the various types of phenop-
tosis and a number of signicant examples can
be found in this latest publication freely available
at: http://protein.bio.msu.ru/biokhimiya/contents/-
v77/pdf/bcm 0707.pdf In particular, it highlights how
the aging of the individuals of our species is classied
as \slow phenoptosis" (\Obligatory and slow phenop-
tosis, subtype B-2: Increasing Age-related mortality in
multicellular eukaryotes"), a term coined by the same
Skulachev.
This call for papers invites to submit articles related to
the phenomenon phenoptosis, in particular:
- Evolutionary mechanisms that determine the phe-
nomenon in its various forms;
- Likewise about the presence or absence of the phe-
nomenon in related species, or in the same species in
dierent conditions;- Physiological mechanisms that determine the phe-
nomenon in its various forms;
- Mechanisms of behavioral phenomena and their neu-
rophysiological roots that determine phenoptotic phe-
nomena;
- Experimental conditions that block, modify, control
or alter the phenomenon.
Articles should be submitted to the journal Bio-
chemistry (Moscow), following the rules for the
authors listed on the site of Springer: http:/-
/www.springer.com/life+sciences/biochemistry+% 26
+ biophysics/journal/10541 and also specifying that
the paper is proposed for the special issues dedicated
to phenoptosis.
Possible questions may be asked to the Editor-in-Chief
Prof. Skulachev (skulach@genebee.msu.ru).
Furthermore, scholars interested in participating in the
Scientic Board are asked to show their willingness.
In particular, this invite is for scholars interested to
phenoptotic phenomena in the following elds:
- Entomology; - Arachnology; - The study of inverte-
brates not included in previous categories; - The study
of vertebrates; - Sociobiology; - Botany; - Single-celled
species.
The above said possible willingness should be addressed
to Prof. Skulachev. Questions about it can be directed
to the same Prof. Skulachev (skulach@genebee.msu.ru)
or, as a preliminary, to the writer of this note (giac-
into.libertini@tin.it).

Data in Arlequin
Dear folks, I've got the following example of msats data
for Arlequim:
[Data] [[Samples]] SampleName=\MICR1" Sample-
Size( SampleData= f
Genot1 27 12 23 17 13 22 16 Genot2 1 15 22 16 13 22
16
The user manual (v.3.1) idicates the following explana-
tion: \To make things clear, the genotype "Genot1\ in
the rst population, has been observed 27 times. For
the rst locus, 12 and 13 repeats were observed, 22 and
23 repeats were observed for the second locus, and -
nally 16 and 17 repeats were found at the third locus."
The questions are: (a) If a Genot1 repeats 27 times,
what are in fact those 12/13, 23/22, and 17/16 repeats?
(b) we have used Arlequim to test population structur-
ing by gene sequences. For example, we supposedly
detected in a sample of 32 specimens a Cyt b haplo-
type occuring 17 times and another one occuring 15
times...Cool! 17+15 2. Comparing such hypothetical
example with that one provided by the user manual forMsats emerges a misunderstanding format .
Thanks a lot and best regards. Rodrigo

Distance between protein sequences
answers
Dear Evoldir Members,
Thank you very much for the answers! Here I summa-
rize them:
Alexandros Stamatakis: you can do this with RAxML,
given that you have an alignment for the prot seqs. Run
RAxML (please get the latest version from GITHUB
at: https://github.com/stamatak/standard-RAxML)
as follows: ./raxmlHPC-SSE3 -P proteinMatrixName -t
referenceTree -s alignment -f x -m PROTGAMMAWAG
-n T1 Via -P you read in the protein substitution ma-
trix: -P Specify the le name of a user-dened AA (Pro-
tein) substitution model. This le must contain 420
entries, the rst 400 being the AA substitution rates
(this must be a symmetric matrix) and the last 20 are
the empirical base frequencies -f x: compute pair-wise
ML distances, ML model parameters will be estimated
on an MP starting tree or a user-dened tree passed
via \-t", only allowed for GAMMA-based models of
rate heterogeneity Don't be irritated by the WAG -
n the model string -m PROTGAMMAWAG RAxML
will ignore WAG and only use the information that the
GAMMA model of rate heterogeneity is to be used.
The -f x option will then just compute pair-wise ML
distances between all pairs of sequences. The starting
tree passed via -t is used to estimate the ML model pa-
rameters (in the above case just the alpha parameter)
that are then used for calculating pair-wise distances.
*****
Gangolf Jobb: Treender can. Use the \MAP" model,
see manual page 28 (www.treender.de).
*****
Gwenna el Bataille: I think the R software should al-
low this, since it is very exible. Books like \analysus
of phylogenetics and evolution with R" by Emmanuel
Paradis could be useful for this, I suppose. Or alterna-
tively, the r-sig-phylo mailing list, where you can ask
specic questions.
*****September 1, 2012 EvolDir 59
Joe Felsenstein: I think it is possible in PAML too.
I have some Mathematica les that calculate various
of the required matrices. We hope to add WAG and
MtREV too to Protdist this year.
*****
Cameron Weadick: You can use the aaratele option
in the PAML software package's CODEML program to
specify your own amino acid substitution rate matrix.
*****
Carolin Kosiol: If you like to use PHYLIP, the AA
substitution matrices need to be encoded in the \prot-
dist.c" le in the form of an eigen-decomposition that
is produced with Mathematica. A description of eigen-
decomposition and other methods to implement substi-
tution matrices can be found in the following article:
Kosiol C and Goldman N, 2005. Dierent versions of
the Dayho rate matrix. Mol Bio Evol 22: 193-199.
I've tried Treender but unfortunately I was not able to
import my aminoacid distance matrix to this software
and I wasn't able to detect the reason why it didn't
like the le format of the matrix. Finally I've solved
the problem with RAxML.

Dear Evoldir Members,
I would like to calculate distances (distance matrix)
between protein sequences using my own predened
aminoacid substitution matrix. Do you know a soft-
ware that allows this? The phylip protdist may allow
it but I was not able to nd a description about the
format of the substitution matrix.
Thanks for the suggestions!

Drosophila isofemale lines
I am currently maintaining a number of Drosophila
melanogaster and D. simulans isofemale lines (listed be-

populations over the last few years. Unfortunately I
am no longer able to maintain these lines and so was
wondering if anyone would be interested in them before
I destroy them.
In addition to the lines themselves, Casey Bergman
and I have recently released whole-genome sequences
for 20 lines from the French population (see http:/-
/bergmanlab.smith.man.ac.uk/?p=1685), and hope in
the near future also to release whole-genome sequences
for 15 lines from each of the Georgia (D. melanogaster)

If anyone would be interested in any of these lines then
please let me know.

Drosophilid genomes
Dear all,
Sorry for a Drosophila-specic question to a general list.
Can anyone tell me if there is a list being main-
tained anywhere of all the Drosophilid species genomes
and transcriptomes that are being (or have been) se-
quenced? Data on Species, Research Group, Genome,
Transcriptome, and expected completion date would be
very welcome.
If no such list exists, but you are currently sequencing
either a genome or a transcriptome, and you don't mind
the research community knowing that you are doing it
- please let me know, and I'll endeavour to create such
a list.
I have somewhat dubious transcriptomes (fragmentary
& highly heterozygous, created from pools of from wild-
caught ies as a side-product of another project) for: D
immigrans, D obscura, D subobscura, D tristis and D
subsilvestris, which I'd be happy to share with inter-
ested parties

EncyclopediaOfLife ResearchWishes
Dear Colleagues,
The Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) is pleased to announce
the call for 'research wishes <http://eol.org/info/347
>.' Users are invited to submit longstanding research
questions that involve a large number of taxa. EOL
will prioritize resources based on the top ten wishes as
voted by the EOL community.
Do you have a longstanding research question, involv-
ing a large number of taxa? Do you suspect the sum
of human knowledge contains enough information to
provide the answer ? Maybe you have never tackled
it because it is just way too much work to extract it
from its myriad locations? Can EOL help? Tell us the
question you want to ask. Tell us the kinds of data you
would need. Let us help get you access to the data that
will allow you to answer the big questions.
Please see the EOL Wishes for Research <http://-
eol.org/info/347 >page for more information, the on-
line nomination form, and details on prizes.
Anyone with a strong interest in science is invited to
articulate a research question. Wishes will be accepted
through September 15, 2012.
Please help us spread the word by sharing this an-September 1, 2012 EvolDir 61
nouncement with your contacts. Questions? Email Jen

Hi, all:
I am interested in any shot that gives some indication
of the size of the group that assembled this year. I
have searched the web and emailed one of the meeting
organizers already; so far, I've been unable to locate
anything. If I had it to do over again, I'd take the
shot myself, preferably from somewhere high up on one
of the escalators between levels 2 and 3 and during a
coee break. But one from one of the poster sessions
before dark might work as well or perhaps even better.
Just wondering if anyone else has something that might
work.
Thanks in advance.

Exemplar species
Dear Colleagues,We need your help creating a list of exemplar species
from across the tree of life!
As our team works to build an open tree of life for the
systematics community, we are also working on an ed-
ucational version of the tree for the public . Our goal
is to depict about 200 better-known (i.e. phylogenet-
ically or otherwise important in some way (pathogen,
food source, etc.)) species from all three domains of life.
The intended audience of this eort includes educators,
students, and the public in general.
Please follow the link below to vote for your 5 best
exemplars... https://www.surveymonkey.com/-

Independence of Dyads
Dear List:
I have a pairwise genetic relatedness matrix that is
610 individuals on a side so their are 185745 unique
dyads. These are divided into four categories: unre-
lated (n9275), half siblings (n234), full siblings (n\6),
and parent-ospring pairs (n). Homogeneity of vari-
ance is decreases in quality with decreased sample size
in each category, as might be expected. I would like to
test the means of the geographic distances between in-
dividuals in each dyad against eachother, but there two
issues to be resolved. First, are these dyads indepen-
dent? E.g., the FS dyad below involves individuals 1
and 3 and the PO dyad also involves individual 1. Sec-
ond, what to do with the grossly uneven sample size?

New documentary about Lynn Margulis
The Revolution is in Progress
Dear Friends and Colleagues of Lynn Margulis,
I am writing to ask your help in raising funds to pro-
duce a documentary lm about the revolutionary ideas
that Lynn Margulis and her colleagues \including many
of you" introduced to the world.
You can help by (1) putting us in touch with in-
dividuals at foundations who know of Lynn's work
and who might be interested in supporting this
lm, (2) sharing any contacts at US and overseas
television networks, and (3) donating directly to
the lm through our not-for-prot partner, the
Global Film Network, on our [2]website. Links:

Ten Questions Everyone Should Ask about Evo-

insisted that I make another lm that addressed
several cutting edge scientic ideas. Together we
had started discussing the content for this new
lm. Now, with the help of Jim MacAllister, I have
begun this exciting and much needed project. I
am gratied by the growing list of her colleagues

change. I expect the lm to be distributed in theatres,
on DVDs, television, museum kiosks, the internet,

Minimum information phylogeniesWhat data makes a phylogenetic tree useful?
When publishing a phylogenetic tree, or evaluating a
tree, we generally want more than simply the tree struc-
ture - for example, who inferred the tree? using what
data and what methods? what are the organisms at the
tips? what are the support values? Of course, those
who use / evaluate trees want as much data as possi-
ble about a tree. Those who publish / database trees
want a quick and simple submission system. How do
we balance these sometimes conicting viewpoints?
The following survey asks you to categorize various data
elements about trees in terms of 1) how useful is the
data? and 2) how dicult is it to collect? The survey
should take about 10 minutes.
https://duke.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=-
SVb2upIMII4fxJkAA This survey is brought to
you by MIAPA and Open Tree of Life. MIAPA
(http://www.evoio.org/wiki/MIAPA) aims to develop
a formal spec for Minimum Information About a
Phylogenetic Analysis. The Open Tree of Life (http:/-
/opentreeoife.org) is collecting input phylogenies for
synthesis into a comprehensive tree of life. We will
share the results via the MIAPA and Open Tree of Life
websites, and results will inform the MIAPA standard
as well as the collection trees for Open Tree of Life.

Project Seahorse and its NGO partner in the Philip-
pines are seeking volunteer, certied SCUBA divers
(minimum 15 logged dives) who are interested in partic-
ipating in a long-term monitoring program for marine
protected areas (MPAs) in northern Bohol, Philippines.
The surveys are conducted biannually, one in the
dry season (March/April) and one in the wet season
(Sept/Oct). An eight-week commitment is required
comprising approximately two weeks of training and
six weeks of survey work. Surveys are easily inuenced
by weather and other unpredictable events, so the du-
ration of the eldwork may vary. If completed quickly,
volunteers will be asked to assist with other conserva-
tion work, such as data encoding or assisting with other
biological eld programs.
Download an application in pdf or Word for-
mat. The application deadline for the Sept/Oct
2012 survey has been extended to Aug 23, 2012.

Shipping dry DNA pellet
Hi,
I was wondering if anyone has experience shipping dry
DNA overseas. Is it possible to just ship tubes with
the dry DNA pellet after a phenol-chloroform extrac-
tion? Is it necessary to use a speed vacuum? Any other
methodsavailable?Thanks in advance for your reply!

Shipping dry DNA pellet answers
Thanks to all of you for your responses!
Please nd below all the messages that I received. For
the most part, people said that they have not experi-
ence problems shipping the dry pellet but some people
expressed some concerns about the ability to resuspend
overdried DNA after applying the speed-vacuum.
Cheers, Margarita
We regularly ship dry DNA and it works very well.
EtOH precipitation and vaccum or air dry. Ship the
pellet as is and rehydrate to use.
Hope this helps

Hi,
The company we currently use asks us to ship DNA in
alcohol, but I think I did post some dry DNA pellet a
long time ago.
Best, Maureen
I don't know whether that helps but I used RNA
stable (Biomatrica: http://www.biomatrica.com/-
rnastable.php) to ship my RNA samples from Germany
to the USA for ^A later microarray analyses - and it
worked pretty well! ^A I know that Biomatrica also oer
\DNAstable" which - as I guess - should work similarly
for DNA samples... For my RNA preparations I needed
to speed vac - I guess it should be the same with DNA...
As far as I remember you can download a pdf from the
Biomatrica homepage which describes the procedures
which are needed for preparing your samples - just have
a look there...
Good luck!September 1, 2012 EvolDir 65

We have good experience with freeze-dried samples. We
received quite some genomic DNA samples from collab-
orators that way, but also normally primers are shipped
freeze dried. I do not know about shipping pellets, but
can tell you that we in rare cases air-dry pellets even
over the weekend (but they are of course dry after a few
hours) and they dissolve ne after the 2 days. So if the
shipping is not too long, drying them and sending them
should work as well. I would not recommend to speed-
vac them completely dry. In my experience an overdried
pellet dissolves only very hard and it's not perfect for
the DNA, either. I would in any case try some mock
samples rst to see if it works for your amounts, pellet
size, extraction method, shipping conditions, ...
Good luck!

it is ne to just ship tubes with the dry DNA pellet di-
rectly after DNA extraction; however, it would be best
to re-suspend the pellet rst to check the quality of the
DNA before you send it. If you do this, then you can
simply allow an aliquot of the re-suspended DNA to
dry out at room temperature or speed vac under a low
heat. It is not always necessary to go to the trouble of
re-precipitating and drying the pellet (which also runs
the risk of you loosing some of your valuable DNA).
Hope this helps, Will G-C
I've done this quite a bit and there's never been a prob-
lem. Drying with a speed-vac would be best but if you
don't have one, then just letting it evaporate would be
ne too. Probably best to put a tissue or something
loosely over the top. You could put it in an incubator
or heat block to speed that evaporation along but don't
set it too warm, else it might aect (denature) the DNA
- no more than 40 deg I reckon. Make sure it's totally
dry before you seal it up and send it.

You should not have problems sending dry DNA. I
have even send DNA in solution through Fedex and
the PCRs worked after been stored in the customs of-
ce for days! DNA is pretty stable, and when is dry
you shouldn't expect much troubles.

I've heard the DNA can be hard to rehydrate after
speed vac drying (I haven't tried so i dont know) It's my
understanding that lyophylizing is better - that's how
primers get shipped If you have access to a lyophylizer,
its pretty easy - just practice with some colored water
before drying your samples so you dont end up sucking
the samples out of the tubes. the key is to make sure
the samples never thaw

What is the size of the DNA which you need to send? If
it's high molecular weight material and the downstream
application is library construction or similar, it might
not be a good idea to vacuum it. We've sent DNA

Software PartitionFinder
Dear All,
We're pleased to announce the release of Partition-
Finder v1.0.1, a program for the combined selection66 EvolDir September 1, 2012
of partitioning schemes and models of molecular evo-
lution. It can automatically and objectively select
the best partitioning scheme and associated models of
molecular evolution for any DNA or protein alignment.
PartitionFinder is free and open source, works on all
major operating systems (see FAQs for Linux), and
runs on multiple processors to make it as fast as possi-
ble.
You can download PartitionFinder here:
www.robertlanfear.com/partitionnder The website
also has links to the manual, FAQs, a tutorial, a google
group for questions, the source code, and the paper in
MBE describing the program and the algorithms it im-
plements.
PartitionFinder can be used to:
* Find best t partitioning schemes for DNA and pro-
tein datasets, given a set of starting partitions * Calcu-
late the AIC, AICc and BIC of any given partitioning
scheme for any given dataset * Calculate best t models
of molecular evolution for partitioned or unpartitioned
datasets * Compare all the usual models of molecular
evolution for DNA and protein alignments
We are actively developing the program, so please do
get in touch if you have questions, suggestions, or com-
ments.

Software SBEToolbox
Dear all,
We present SBEToolbox (Systems Biology and Evo-
lution Toolbox), an open-source Matlab toolbox for
biological network analysis. It calculates a variety
of centralities and topological metrics, clusters nodes
into modules, and interactively displays the network
using dierent graph layout algorithms. Ecient
lightweight design allows large-scale networks to be
handled. Straightforward implementation and the in-
clusion of high-level functions allow the functionality to
be easily extended or tailored. SBEGUI, a menu-driven
GUI of SBEToolbox, is highly interactive, enabling easy
usage of most network and graph algorithms without
prior knowledge of programming. The stand-alone ex-
ecutable SBEGUI, running on all major operating sys-
tems, does not require the installation of Matlab sys-
tem. Availability: Pre-compiled stand-alone executable
for all major operating systems and source code are
freely available at http://sbetoolbox.sourceforge.net .
Your comments are always welcome.

Deadline for applications: 31st August
Postdoc position in Plant Evolutionary Genetics at
Newcastle University, UK. We are looking for an en-
thusiastic postdoc for a 3-year NERC-funded research
project entitled: 'Inter-genomic conict in gynodioecy
and its eects on molecular evolution of mitochondrial
genomes in the genus Plantago'.
The applicant will be based in Kirsten Wol's group
in the School of Biology, Newcastle University, and will
collaborate closely with Deborah Charlesworth's group
at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology, University ofSeptember 1, 2012 EvolDir 73
Edinburgh, where an additional postdoc will be part of
the same project.
This project will use molecular evolutionary approaches
to investigate the maintenance of cytonuclear polymor-
phisms in gynodioecious plants in the genus Plantago,
to test whether an 'arms race' situation prevails, versus
long-term balancing selection. In the project we will
be obtaining and analysing DNA sequences of multi-
ple nuclear and mitochondrial genes, to compare diver-
sity, and test for long-term balancing selection. Non-
gynodioecious species will be studied, as well as gynodi-
oecious ones, to provide outgroups for sequence anal-
yses and to test whether the high diversity expected
under long-term balancing selection is conned to the
gynodioecious species. The project also includes testing
for paternal inheritance/leakage by testing for hetero-
plasmy in natural populations of P. lanceolata, using
analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequence haplotypes
and studies of ospring of reciprocal crosses to assess
the possibility that within-species polymorphism could
explain the highly elevated mutation rates estimated in
Plantago lineages.
The work will be divided between Edinburgh and New-
castle. For example, the Edinburgh group will concen-
trate on the nuclear genes, while the Newcastle group
will obtain the mitochondrial genes, while other work is
shared. Field work and greenhouse work will predomi-
nantly be done by the Newcastle postdoc.
Applicants must have completed their PhD before
starting the position. Applicants should have some ex-
perience with molecular genetic techniques, and an in-
terest in population genetics.
Further information can be obtained through vacancy
information available on the Newcastle University web
site, reference number D1082R. On the web site http:/-

in your vacancy search and when applying for the job.
Applications must be submitted through this electronic

September.
The start date is 1 October 2012 or as soon as possible
thereafter.

*Position: Post-Doctoral Researcher V Evolution of
male pheromones in moths*
*Date:* Position available immediately
*Salary: *Commensurate with training and experience
*Term:* 3 years
*Position Description: *The *Post-Doctoral Re-
searcher* will work with C. Schal (NCSU) and A. Groot
(NCSU & University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands)
on an NSF-funded project. In many moth species,
male pheromone is important for species-recognition
and female acceptance of males. However, despite
the recognition that males invest disproportionately
in the tissues that produce these pheromones, their
roles in advertising male quality and guiding female
mate choice have not been considered. This project
addresses two major questions: (a) How does natu-
ral variation in close-range sexual signals aect female
choice in moth species where the male pheromone re-
sembles the female pheromone? and (b) Is the pro-
duction of male sexual signals linked to production
of female signals in these species? Specically, the
postdoc and a graduate student will: (1) chemically
identify the close-range male pheromones in two moth
species (fall armyworm *Spodoptera frugiperda*, and
tobacco budworm *Heliothis virescens*), (2) quantify
the magnitude of between-strain intraspecic variation
in the male pheromones, and (3) evaluate what variable
features of the male pheromone contribute to female
choice.
Portions of this project will be conducted at the Uni-
versity of Amsterdam, providing a unique opportunity
to be trained and conduct research in an international
collaborative setting.
*Qualications: *Ph.D. trained in evolutionary biol-
ogy, entomology, behavior, biology, chemistry, or re-
lated elds. Experience in chemical ecology, including
behavioral assays and purication and identication of

OhioStateU EvolutionPlants
Post-doctoral position on the impact of plant domesti-
cation on the evolution of plant-associated organisms.
We seek a postdoctoral researcher to join an inter-
disciplinary project studying the impacts of plant do-
mestication on the evolution of plant-associated organ-
isms. The genetic bottlenecks that accompany selective
sweeps profoundly aect the levels of genetic diversity
found in domesticated plant species, while also aect-
ing loci underlying important morphological, physiolog-
ical, ecological, and biochemical characteristics. The
dramatic change in the genetic diversity of plant hosts
can also have cascading eects on genome evolution in
the community of associated organisms. In the long
term, this project seeks to identify the genes that led
to domestication-induced adaptive divergence and spe-
ciation in both plant and plant-associated organisms.
Our project focuses on chile pepper (Capsicum an-
nuum) as a model system to understand the molec-
ular basis of coevolution at multiple scales from the
genome to the organism, and, eventually, the commu-
nity. C. annuum, one of the most diverse species within
its genus and cultivated world-wide, includes nearly 50
recognized types that range from the mildest bell pep-per to the hottest cayenne. The focus region of the
study will be Mexico, which is C. annuum's center of

We seek a postdoctoral researcher to join an inter-

sweeps profoundly aect the levels of genetic diversity
found in domesticated plant species, while also aect-
ing loci underlying important morphological, physiolog-
ical, ecological, and biochemical characteristics. The
dramatic change in the genetic diversity of plant hosts
can also have cascading eects on genome evolution in
the community of associated organisms. In the long
term, this project seeks to identify the genes that led
to domestication-induced adaptive divergence and spe-
ciation in both plant and plant-associated organisms.
Our project focuses on chile pepper (Capsicum an-
nuum) as a model system to understand the molec-
ular basis of coevolution at multiple scales-from the
genome to the organism, and, eventually, the commu-
nity. C. annuum, one of the most diverse species within
its genus and cultivated world-wide, includes nearly 50
recognized types that range from the mildest bell pep-
per to the hottest cayenne. The focus region of the
study will be Mexico, which is C. annuum's center of
domestication, where its progenitor (Capsicum annuum

settings. Research questions will relate to: C. an-

An astonishing outcome of the antagonistic coevolu-
tionary dynamics between host and parasite is the evo-
lution of parasite ability to interfere with host phys-
iology. The molecular details of such interference is
poorly understood, limiting our ability to decipher par-
asite virulence and its evolution.
A major component of parasite mediated 'host repro-
gramming' targets host metabolism and thereby results
in improved parasite growth. A particularly striking
example of this is the ability of several viruses to in-
crease the rate of glycolysis in infected cells by up to
370%. More elaborate modulations include, for exam-
ple, the alteration of lipid and GTP biosynthesis. These
ndings strongly indicate that a full understanding of
host-pathogen interaction and pathogen-caused diseasestates require a holistic view that considers host and
the pathogen as a single system.
This project will concentrate on the interaction of
Burkholderia pseudomallei and Francisella tularensis
with human macrophages. Utilizing metabolic mod-
eling together with phenotypic proling and ux mea-
surements, we will achieve a better understanding of
how these parasites manipulate their host and cause
disease. The ultimate aim is to develop better strate-
gies of combating intracellular parasites and developing
robust analysis approaches at the host-parasite systems
level.
To apply, please send your CV, covering letter (detail-
ing your motivation) and the details of three referees
to Orkun S. Soyer by 1st of October quoting the job

Applications are invited for a postdoctoral research po-
sition in the laboratory of Vaishali Katju in the Depart-
ment of Biology at the University of New Mexico. Our
lab employs molecular and bioinformatic tools to study
evolutionary processes at the level of genomes and pop-
ulations (both experimental and natural). Our bioin-
formatic work has historically focused on elucidating
the genomic characteristics and structural features of
evolutionarily recent gene duplicates in the C. elegans
and S. cerevisiae genomes. We recently expanded our
studies to assay long-term C. elegans mutation accu-
mulation lines for the frequency of copy-number vari-
ants using oligonucleotide array comparative genomic
hybridization (oaCGH) to provide the rst direct esti-
mate of the spontaneous rate of gene duplication in a
multicellular eukaryote (Lipinski et al. 2011, Current
Biology). We have conducted a long-term mutation ac-
cumulation experiment at varying eective population
sizes in C. elegans. Specically, we aim to understand
the molecular and phenotypic consequences of muta-
tion under varying intensities of natural selection. Our
aims, among others, include (i) characterizing the dis-tribution of tness eects of dierent classes of muta-
tion, (ii) their tness impacts via phenotypic assays and
(iii) quantifying the spontaneous rate of ectopic gene
conversion. The project details are exible, but will fo-
cus on annotation of whole-genome sequences of these
experimental C. elegans populations and characteriza-
tion of the mutations in dierent genomic backgrounds
and their frequencies. The ideal candidate should have
demonstrable expertise in population genetics, molec-
ular evolutionary analyses and computational biology.
Familiarity with experimental use of C. elegans, anal-
ysis of high-throughput sequencing data or quantita-
tive/statistical genetics is a plus.

evolutionary forces that shape genomic variation, and
(2) Integrating Drosophila population genomic data
with other information sources - such as mapping, ex-

to phenotypic dierences between closely-related pop-
ulations from contrasting environments). Applicants
proposing to work on either or both of these areas
will be considered for this position. Potential projects
could include: * Using population genomic data and
mapping approaches to identify genes underlying the
parallel evolution of melanism within D. melanogaster
(Pool et al. 2007 Mol Ecol; Rebeiz et al 2009 Sci-ence). * Developing new stastical methods for pop-
ulation genomic data. Examples could include: sep-
arating the inuence of population history and natu-
ral selection on genetic variation; more eective use of
haplotype information in the inference of demography

Manchester Morphmetrics
Nov5-Dec14
Dear colleagues
I am pleased to announce this year's morphometrics
course from the University of Manchester. This year's
course will run in the six weeks from 5 November to 14
December 2012.
The course information can be found on the following
we site: http://www.ywings.org.uk/MorphoCourse
Course content: * Data acquisition: the kinds of data
and the equipment used to collect them. * Deni-
tions of size and shape * Geometric methods to char-
acterise shape from a conguration of landmark points
(Procrustes superimposition) * Statistics of variation,
scatter plots, basic multivariate statistics * Principal
component analysis * Measurement error and outliers
* Shape transformations and 'warping' { the thin plate
spline * Analysis of outline shapes * Distinguishing be-
tween groups (taxonomy, clinical diagnosis, etc.) * Al-
lometry and size correction * Inuence of external fac-
tors on shape (ecomorphology, dose-response studies)
* Symmetric forms and measurement of asymmetry. *
Morphometric inferences on developmental processes *
Morphological integration and modularity * Genetics of
shape: analyses of resemblance between relatives, QTL
analyses. * Phylogeny: reconstructing the evolution of
shape
Practice examples: As far as possible, practical exer-cises are provided to accompany the course content.
These practice exercises consist of data sets and expla-
nations on how to run the respective analyses using
the MorphoJ software (http://www.ywings.org.uk/-
MorphoJ page.htm). Participants who already have
their own data are encouraged to use those and to dis-
cuss them as part of the course. I hope there will be a
bit of a 'workshop' feel to the course unit.
Group work: Participants will work in small groups
to prepare web presentations of possible morphome-
tric studies (blogs or wikis prepared by the groups).
This activity stimulates discussion and provides a broad
overview of the broad range of questions that can be
addressed with morphometric methods.
The fee for the course is GBP 300.00 (I'm afraid it's
gone up again from last year { this is out of my con-
trol).
All prospective participants need to pre-register for the
course. The deadline for this is the *14 September
2012*.
For further details and the pre-registration form, see
the course web page: http://www.ywings.org.uk/-

Marine biodiversity NGS
Workshop on \Next-Generation Sequencing technolo-
gies and Informatics tools for studying Marine Biodi-
versity and Adaptation"
1-3 October 2012, Institute of Marine Biology and Ge-
netics (IMBG) - HCMR, Heraklion, Crete, Greece.
https://sites.google.com/site/workshopimbg/
DNA sequencing and genotyping technologies are ad-
vancing very fast, with the development of novel
methodologies and machinery and the utilization of
new types of molecular markers, giving insights into
genomes rapidly, thus changing both the scale and the92 EvolDir September 1, 2012
mode of genetic analysis. This oers a unique oppor-
tunity to get better insights into marine genetic biodi-
versity and to study adaptive genetic variation, devel-
opmental and molecular physiology mechanisms that
allow organisms to adapt to new environments (e.g. cli-
matic changes, invasions, new pathogens).
This workshop aims to: a) present key concepts on
Next-Generation DNA sequencing and genotyping tech-
niques b) provide a comprehensive overview of available
bioinformatics tools for analyzing whole genomes, dis-
covering molecular markers, genes and annotation, c)
present the advantages and caveats of new approaches
for studying genetic biodiversity, d) integrate these new
approaches into population and conservation genomics,
phylogenomics and adaptation.
The workshop will consist of a series of lectures that
cover various aspects of marine biodiversity and adap-
tation. Invited speakers are chosen based on their eec-
tiveness in teaching theory and practice in genetic di-
versity, genomics, phylogenomics, and adaptation. In-
cluded among the faculty are developers and other ex-
perts in the use of computer programs and packages for
the analysis of high-throughput data.
Who can attend: The workshop targets mainly PhD
students and post-docs, but also researchers interested
in high-throughput DNA analysis methods.
Registration is free.

Behaviour and speciation
FroSpects Workshop
Time:
Feb 6, 2013 - Feb 8, 2013
Program outline
Oral presentations and discussions focusing on keyquestions on behavioural aspects in speciation research.
Summary
Many populations are thought to be reproductively iso-
lated from other such populations (i.e. they are dier-
ent species) by choice. That is, individuals from the
dierentiated populations are capable of mating with
each other and produce fertile ospring but they do not
do so due to a lack of sexual attraction; the populations
are reproductively isolated by pre-mating barriers. This
is but one example of the potential importance of be-
havioural mechanisms in hindering gene ow and hence
in speciation. In this workshop we intend to explore
behavioural interactions between dierentiated popu-
lations in secondary contact and sympatry and address
their importance in population divergence, convergence
and speciation, focusing on both empirical and theo-
retical approaches. Relevant topics include: learning,
genes and species recognition; the behavioural ecology
of reinforcement; intra- and intersexual signalling and
communication in hybrid zones; behavior and hybrid
speciation.
Application procedure
Prospective participants should send an application by
email to the organizers (see addresses below) containing
a brief CV with a list of publications (if any) together
with a one-paragraph statement of motivation. The ap-
plication should also include a one-paragraph (no more
than 100 words) suggestion of a proposition within the
scope of the workshop. The organizers will look at these
suggestions and give as many proponents as possible the
chance to 'sell' their idea to the participants as short
talks during the workshop.
Applications will be accepted between six and two
months before the workshop. Later applications can
be considered if places are available.

Sep30-Oct5
Autumn school 'AN INTRODUCTION TO CONSER-
VATION GENOMICS'
Sept 30 - Oct 5 2012, Turku, Finland
http://www.ru.nl/congenomics/activities/autumn-
school/ Conservation genomics is an exciting new eld
that is developing out of the merging of conservation
genetics with ecological and evolutionary genomics.
By using the latest genomic technologies conservation
genomics can now concentrate for example on the ap-
plication of genome-wide markers to reliably estimate
demographic and genetic parameters in a conservation
context and use gene-expression tools to study the
mechanisms behind important conservation genetic
processes, such as inbreeding depression.
During this autumn school we specically focus on the
application and technical aspects of genomic techniques
and how these genomic techniques can be used to ad-
dress topical questions in conservation biology. Our
goal is to focus on the use of genomics techniques, in
particular next-generation sequencing (NGS) method-ologies, in conservation biology specically for non-
model species. The autumn school is aimed at early-
career researchers who have some background knowl-
edge in basic genetics and conservation biology but who
have an interest in learning more about topics that are
related to the application of genomic technologies in
conservation biology.
Held in an informal but stimulating scientic atmo-
sphere, with a limited number of participants (ca
30) and teachers (ca 5), we hope that this autumn
school will provide an excellent opportunity to intro-
duce young scientists (PhD students and postdocs) to
the complex eld of conservation genomics and famil-
iarise them with the application of genomic techniques
in conservation biology.
PRELIMINARY PROGRAMME:
SUNDAY SEPT 30 (late afternoon/evening) { Arrival
plus introductory lecture
MONDAY OCT 1 { Introduction to Conservation Ge-
nomics

UAzores MarineDNABarcoding
Sep3-7
The Workshop on Marine DNA Barcoding will be held
on the campus of the University of the Azores, Depart-
ment of Biology on 3rd-7th September 2012. Speakers:
Dr. Dirk Erpenbek (DEES-GeoBioCenterLMU), Dr.
Dirk Steinke (BIO-UG), Dr. Filipe O. Costa (CBMA-
UM), Dr. Joana Micael (CIBIO-A cores), Dr. Joana
R. Xavier (CIBIO-A cores), Dr. Manuela I. Parente
(CIBIO-A cores), Dr. Sergio Stefanni (DOP/UA c). The
workshop was designed for graduate/undergraduate
students and researchers that would like to employ the
DNA Barcoding approach in their studies. The fo-
cus will be on the concepts underlying the DNA Bar-
coding through theoretical and practical sessions. All
the stages of this approach, from sample collection to
data analyses, will be addressed. Discussions will cover
data management and selected case studies. The work-
shop will include:- Specimen handling and data cap-September 1, 2012 EvolDir 95
ture in the eld;- Tissue sampling, preservation and
archiving;- BOLD submission of sample spreadsheets
and images;- DNA extraction;- PCR amplication;- Se-
quence edition and BOLD sequence submission;- Se-
quence analyses. Theoretical sessions are free. Prac-
tical sessions are limited to a maximum of 15 partici-
pants, selected in the basis of their CV. The applicationform and CV should be sent to Manuela Parente (mpar-
ente@uac.pt).The deadline for submission of applicant's
CVs is the 25th August 2012. For more information,

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterword
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
