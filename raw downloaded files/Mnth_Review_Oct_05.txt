stracts Deadline:
We announce the fourth biennial conference on the De-
velopmental Basis of Evolutionary Change at the Uni-
versity of Chicago during 20-23 October 2005. This
four-day, graduate student-organized conference has a
tradition of assembling, at the intersection of evolution
and development, a fellowship of faculty and student
conferees of diverse intellectual interests. As such, it
has been a fertile occasion for initiating unexpected col-
laborations and probing new ideas.
WE EXTEND THE ABSTRACT SUBMISSION
DEADLINE TO 1 OCTOBER FROM 20 SEPTEM-
BER. The early registration deadline remains 8 Octo-
ber.4 EvolDir October 1, 2005
The conference will open with keynote addresses by
Peter Holland of the University of Oxford and Naomi
Pierce of Harvard University. The themes of the four
plenary sessions are Sensation and Sensory Networks;
History and Philosophy of Evolutionary and Develop-
mental Thought; Ecology, Development and Evolution;
and Genetic Regulation, Evolution and Development.
The conﬁrmed speakers for each plenary session can be

GEOMETRIC MORPHOMETRICS WORKSHOP
IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY AMES, IOWA, USA
May 29 - June 2, 2006
An NSF-sponsored Morphometrics workshop will be
held at Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa, USA from
May 29 to June 2, 2006. The instructors will be: Dean
C. Adams (Iowa State University), F. James Rohlf
(SUNY Stony Brook), and Dennis E. Slice (University
of Vienna). Keynote speaker: Fred L. Bookstein (Uni-
versity of Washington).
This is a 1-week workshop which provides a compre-
hensive introduction to both the theory and methods
for the analysis of biological shape. Emphasis is on un-
derstanding the theoretical background of the ﬁeld, as
well as the practical mechanics of both landmark and
outline methods for shape analysis. The main objective
of the workshop is to provide students with suﬃcient
knowledge of these approaches that they will be able6 EvolDir October 1, 2005
to eﬀectively and correctly apply them to their own
research programs. Applications in Ecology and Evo-
lution will be emphisized.
The workshop is limited to 20 participants who will
be provided with travel grants that include room and
board during the workshop. Applications must be re-
ceived by OCTOBER 1, 2005 to receive full considera-
tion.
Further details on the workshop and application proce-
dure may be found at: http://www.public.iastate.edu/-

Dear Friends and Colleagues,
This email is to inform you of a one-day meeting en-
titled Understanding Human Altruism. The meeting
will be held at the University of Sussex on Tuesday, 11
October 2005.
The purpose of the meeting is two-fold. First, it will be
an opportunity to hear some recent results in the ﬁeld
of human altruism. If you are interested in making a
presentation, then please let me know ASAP, providing
a title and a short abstract. This should be submitted
to altruism@sussex.ac.uk .10 EvolDir October 1, 2005
Secondly, the day will be an opportunity to organise
fund-raising eﬀorts and collaborative research on hu-
man altruism. In addition, if participants feel that a
UK-based centre for studies on human altruism would
be useful, then this meeting could serve as an opportu-
nity to decide on the basic structure and activities of
such an organisation.
Speakers at the meeting will include some of the main
contributors of research in the area of human altruism
and cooperation. Among them are:
Robert Boyd (University of California)
Robin Dunbar (University of Liverpool)
Simon Gaechter (University of Nottingham)
Herbert Gintis (Santa Fe Institute)
Mark Van Vugt (University of Kent)
David Sloan Wilson (State University of New York)
Presentations at the meeting will cover topics such as
reputation and altruism, group selection, reciprocity,
experimental economics, and theoretical evolutionary
studies.
The registration fee for the meeting is £30 for students,
and£45 for all others. (That is 30 UK pounds for stu-
dents, and 45 UK pounds for all others.) This covers
admission, coﬀee, tea, and a light lunch. Only regis-
tered delegates will be admitted. To register, please
ﬁll out a registration form, which you can ﬁnd at
www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/altruism . Send it by as an
email attachment to altruism@sussex.ac.uk , or send it

Goettingen MolPhylogenetics
G¨ ottingen, Germany: Research Associate (PhD) posi-
tion in molecular phylogenetics and phylogenomics.
We invite applications for a research associate position
in a project funded by the German Research Founda-
tion (DFG) A combined phylogenomic and palaeonto-
logical approach to resolve deep phylogenetic incongru-
ences among Phylum Porifera“ in the newly established
DFG Priority Programme 1174: ”Deep Metazoan“ The
project is located in the Department of Geobiology
(Working group of Junior Prof. Dr. Gert W¨ orheide) of
the Geoscience Centre of the University of G¨ ottingen
(Germany). The Dept. of Geobiology is also part of
the G¨ ottingen Centre for Biodiversity and Ecology.
Topic: The phylogenetic relationships among lower
metazoan groups (i.e. diploblast taxa Porifera,
Ctenophora, Cnidaria) are still under hot debate and
are far from being resolved. Uncertainty also exists
about whether poriferans (sponges) are monophyletic
or paraphyletic. If the latter turns out to be corrobo-
rated, it has signiﬁcant implications for the evolution of
”higher“ animals, as it would suggest that the most re-
cent common ancestor of Eumetazoa was similar to an
adult sponge. This project will use, for the ﬁrst time, a
combined phylogenomic, bioinformatic and palaeonto-
logical approach aiming to resolve phylogenetic incon-
gruences at the base of the metazoan tree and ﬁrmly
date cladogeneses and ﬁrst appearances of poriferan
clades. The main responsibilities of the successful can-
didate will be 1) to construct cDNA libraries of major
poriferan lineages and prepare for large scale EST se-
quencing; 2) to work towards a multi-marker molecular
phylogeny of main poriferan lineages; 3) to carry outphylogenomic analyses of EST- and genome sequences.
This project will be carried out in close collaboration
with Prof. Morgenstern (Bioinformatics) and Prof. Re-
itner (Precambrian/Cambrian diploblast fossil record).
We are seeking a highly motivated applicant with excel-
lent molecular- phylogenetic skills, both in the lab and
in silico, demonstrated by an above-average MSc (or
equivalent, e.g. German Diplom”) degree in a related
ﬁeld.
The successful candidate will join a young and dynamic
lab focussing on micro- and macroevolution in marine
invertebrates. More information about the lab can be
found at www.geobiology.nu . The opportunity to enrol
in the new PhD study course Biodiversity and Ecology“
will be given.
Requirements: Degree in Biology (MA, MSc, or equiva-
lent degree); very good and demonstrated knowledge of
molecular lab techniques and understanding of molec-
ular evolution including methods to infer molecular
phylogenies and state-of-the art computer programs
for such analyses; excellent English language skills.
Good working knowledge of UNIX/LINUX and Perl or
Python strongly desirable.
Deadline for applications: 01 October 2005. The posi-
tion is available for 2 years and will be paid according
to the German BATIIa salary scheme (part time).
Application: Send application including letter of in-
tent, CV, PDF’s of publications (if available), and
details of 2 referees as PDF (only) by email or
snail mail to Gert W¨ orheide (gert.woerheide@geo.uni-
goettingen.de). Only applications stating the keyword
”DEEP-PORI“ will be accepted.
The Department of Geobiology of the Geoscience Cen-
tre of the University of G¨ ottingen oﬀers an excellent
multidisciplinary research environment, its particular
strength being due to the close interaction between
Geosciences, the G¨ ottingen Centre for Biodiversity and
Ecology and the Biological Faculty including Bioinfor-

PlantBreeding
PhD: Evolution of gene regulation in Cologne, Germany
A PhD position is available at the Max Planck Insti-
tute for Plant Breeding Research in Cologne, Germany;starting in October 2005 to join a newly funded group
in the department of Genetics and Plant Breeding (dir.
Prof. Maarten Koornneef).
Applicants with interest in a combination of evolution-
ary biology and molecular studies of diversity are in-
vited to apply. A background in plant biology and/or
gene regulation is not a prerequisite.
Our group is interested in evaluating the role played by
cis-regulatory regions in adaptive evolution. For this,
we are studying the evolutionary dynamics of functional
non-coding regions within and among closely related
species of the Arabidopsis genus. Our ultimate goal is
to relate this diversity to its ecological role in natural
environments. Cis-regulatory evolution remains largely
unexplored and there is plenty of room for investigating
novel evolutionary concepts and ideas. Take the chance
to step into this exciting research area !
The successful applicant will examine whether or not
the history of functional cis-regulatory diﬀerences is as-
sociated to adaptive evolution. For this, he/she will ex-
amine three closely related Arabidopsis species that dif-
fer substantially in their life history and ecology : Ara-
bidopsis thaliana, A. halleri and A. lyrata. He/She will
focus on genes involved in the regulation and produc-
tion of ﬂavonoids, which are plant secondary metabo-
lites involved in plant-environment interactions, and as
such likely to play a role in adaptive evolution. First,
he/she will identify interspeciﬁc cis-regulatory changes
that are relevant for phenotypic evolution. Subse-
quently he/she will investigate how these cis-regulatory
regions vary within and among species at both nu-
cleotide and functional levels, with the double goal of
characterizing the genetic basis of promoter functional
changes and reconstructing their recent evolutionary
fate.
The Max Planck Institute oﬀers an outstanding envi-
ronment for carrying out ambitious and innovative re-
search. The Department of Genetics and Plant Breed-
ing brings together plant molecular biologists, quanti-
tative geneticists and evolutionary biologists to investi-
gate the causes and consequences of plant natural vari-
ation. The Institute beneﬁts from a superb interdisci-
plinary scientiﬁc community, with world class molecular
biology being performed and active contacts with out-
standing evolutionary geneticists located in the nearby
University of Cologne.
Cologne, the metropolis on the Rhine, has just over
one million inhabitants and is the fourth-largest city in
Germany. It oﬀers plenty of cultural and recreational
activities. The city further beneﬁts from its central
location in the European travel network. Trains go di-
rectly from downtown Cologne to Frankfurt Interna-14 EvolDir October 1, 2005
tional Airport. Low cost air companies operate at the
local airport (K¨ oln-Bonn) and can take you anywhere
in Europe in a couple of hours.

stitute/Departmental websites at http://-

NCStateU QuantitativeTraits
Department of Genetics at North Carolina State Uni-
versity
Research Training Program in the Genetic Architecture
of Quantitative Traits
The National Institute of General Medical Sciences of
the National Institutes of Health has awarded the De-
partment of Genetics an Institutional Research Train-
ing Grant for predoctoral training in “The Genetic Ar-
chitecture of Quantitative Traits.”
Quantitative, or complex, traits are aﬀected by multi-
ple interacting genes, each of which have small eﬀects
and are sensitive to the environment. Understanding
the molecular nature of genetic variation for quantita-
tive traits will have an enormous impact on medicine,
livestock and crop breeding, and the study of evolution.
For over half a century North Carolina State University
has been a leading center for research in quantitative
genetics. To enable future scientists to advance our un-
derstanding of the genetic architecture of quantitative
traits, we oﬀer a research and training program that in-tegrates quantitative, population, molecular and devel-
opmental genetics, statistics and molecular evolution.
Our program oﬀers:
* $20,772 stipend with tuition and health insurance *
Travel allowance and research funds * State-of-the-art
research facilities * Internationally recognized faculty
with expertise in theoretical and experimental quanti-
tative genetics * A stimulating academic environment
near the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
Duke University and the Research Triangle Park * A
beautiful and aﬀordable location with a pleasant cli-
mate between the beaches and the Appalachian moun-
tains
US citizens and permanent residents are eligible for
Fellowships. The Department of Genetics is strongly
committed to promoting diversity in the scientiﬁc com-
munity and encourages applications from individuals of
historically under-represented minority groups.

*The Department of Biology, *Norwegian University
of Science and Technology (NTNU) announces a va-
cant PhD fellowship on the program ?Eﬀects of captive
breeding on genetic variation and life history traits?.
Applications are invited for a 3-year PhD position, pos-
sibly 4 years, with Prof. Gunilla Rosenqvist and Dr.
Christophe P´ elabon at the Department of Biology.
Applicants are obliged to engage on an organised PhD
training program, and appointment requires approval
of the applicant’s plan for a PhD (dr.scient) study.
A contract regarding the period of appointment and
the obligations of the PhD fellow must be signed by
the Fellow and the University. The Department has
36 members of faculty (professors and associate profes-
sors) and about 70 PhD students and post docs. The
department incorporates research programs in cell bi-
ology, molecular biology, plant and animal physiology
and ecophysiology, ethology, evolutionary biology, pop-
ulation genetics, aquatic and terrestrial ecology, bio-
diversity, aquaculture, and marine biology, with con-
siderable collaboration between the disciplines. More
information about the Department of Biology can be
found at: http://www.bio.ntnu.no/ This PhD project
is integrated within a larger research program that aims
to estimate the eﬀects of diﬀerent captive breeding pro-
grams on genetic variation and life history traits using
the guppy (Poecilia reticulata) as a model. The project
takes advantage of a breeding program conducted now
for nine generations with diﬀerent breeding designs in
terms of degrees of polygyny. Genetic variance at the
molecular level and on quantitative traits will be esti-
mated and compared between the diﬀerent treatments.
Life history and behavioural traits will also be analyzed
and compared between the captive and wild ﬁsh. These
results will be used to test predictions from theoretical
models on the loss of genetic variation with drift. The
proposed research project is likely to involve interna-
tional as well as Norwegian collaborative work.
Applicants should have the minimum qualiﬁcation of
internationally recognized masters degree (or the equiv-
alent, e.g. UK honours degree). Applicants should have
a background from behavioural ecology, preferably re-
lating to evolutionary biology and/or life history the-16 EvolDir October 1, 2005
ory. Some knowledge in molecular biology is also an
advantage.
/ /
The appointment of the PhD fellow will be made ac-
cording to national guidelines for appointment of PhD
fellows at universities and university colleges.
The appointment will be made according to the gen-
eral regulations regarding university employees. The
government work force of Norway should reﬂect the di-
versity of the population, and this is an ?Equal Op-
portunities position?. The annual salary of the PhD
position is NOK 292.000,- per year (code 1017, level
39 according to the government pay-scale for university
employees). There is 2% deduction for superannuation.

partment of Ecology and Evolution in my group
(http://www.unil.ch/dee/page6764.html and http://-
www.unil.ch/dee/page6764.html ) to investigate the
consequences of non additive gene actions on the evo-
lutionary potential of species. The successful candi-
dates will develop an individual based model to simu-
late the evolution of populations anchored to realistic
landscapes. At the same time, statistical methods to
analyse the data will be developed. The type of ques-
tions that will be adressed are -What type of relation is
expected between diﬀerentiation at molecular markers
and that obtained from traits with diﬀerent genetic ar-
chitectures? -How do these traits react to demographic
bottlenecks? Under various mating systems, how well
do genetic markers estimate pedigree inbreeding and
relatedness?
Candidates should be theoretically minded biologists,
with a solid background in mathematics, statistics and
computing. Fluency in C/C++ as well as S is a plus.
The PhD studentship will involve some teaching, some

A three-year Ph.D. position is available from January 1,
2006 at the Anthropological Institute and Museum at
the University of Zurich, Switzerland. The project will
involve population genetics, phylogeography, as well as
paternity and relatedness analyses. The position is for
three years, beginning in January 2006. The remu-
neration package is very competitive with a salary of

gree (or equivalent) is a prerequisite for acceptance into
the Ph.D. program at the University of Zurich.
The genetics group in the Anthropological Institute fo-
cuses on evolutionary genetics of primates, in particular
great apes, but also other large-brained mammals. In
particular, we are interested in male cooperation and
reproductive strategies, as well as the nature of cultural
behaviour. Using modern DNA techniques, our current
work focuses on genetic relationships among cooperat-
ing individuals, quantifying reproductive success, and
linking social correlates with population genetic and
phylogeographic patterns.
Another major interest is the nature and transmission
of culture in both primates and cetaceans. Studying
the convergent evolution of culture in both terrestrial
and marine habitats will help to understand what have
led to the rise of human culture.
The successful candidate is expected to work at least
10 hours a week on other projects in the Institute.
Interested candidates should submit a Curriculum vi-
tae and statement of research interests, along with a
list of two references, by email or post to the address

Postgraduate (PhD) position (“doktorandtj¨ anst”) in
Animal Ecology
The Department of Ecology and Evolution at the Uni-
versity of Uppsala seeks a PhD candidate for the project
“The evolution of ornaments in Sabethes mosquitoes”.
Male-female coevolution of reproductive behavior, mor-
phology and physiology is well documented in many
taxa. Yet, the evolutionary processes responsible for
such concerted evolution is poorly understood in most
cases, and this is particularly true for the evolution
of costly ornaments. In the current project, neotrop-
ical mosquitoes of the genus Sabethes will be used as a
model system. The aquatic larvae of these insects are
inconspicuous but the adults are iridescent and wear
colorful ornaments on their mid-legs. The aim of this
PhD project is to assess sexual selection on, and con-
straints on the evolution of, ornaments in this group
of insects. The candidate will use a variety of diﬀerent
methods, such as manipulative behavioral studies and
artiﬁcial selection experiments on laboratory popula-
tions of these mosquitoes as well as comparative studies
and ﬁeld work.
The successful candidate should have a MSc (or equiv-
alent) in biology/ecology and a strong interest in evo-
lutionary biology and behavioral ecology. The can-
didate will join a collaborative research group, cur-
rently consisting of 3 other PhD students, 3 post-
doctoral associates and one senior scientist (G¨ oran
Arnqvist). The latter will function as a supervisor
(see http://www.ebc.uu.se/zooeko/GoranA/GA.html )
and the candidate will receive her/his postgraduate
training within the postgraduate school at the Evo-
lutionary Biology Centre (see http://www.ebc.uu.se/-
index eng.htm ). This position is ﬁnanced by the
Swedish Research Council and is for four full years,
and the successful candidate will receive a postgrad-
uate fellowship the ﬁrst year (14.400 SEK/month)
and a postgraduate position year 2-4 (18.700 - 20.900
SEK/month).
Applications should include (1) personal informa-
tion/background, (2) complete CV (3) a description
of undergraduate training, (4) an authorized copy of
the undergraduate degree and (5) the names and email
addresses of two-three referees. Applications should
be sent to G¨ oran Arnqvist, Dept. of Animal Ecology,EBC, Norbyv. 18D, University of Uppsala, SE-752 36
Uppsala, Sweden. Please feel free to contact G¨ oran
Arnqvist by email (Goran.Arnqvist@ebc.uu.se) or by

IndianaU DaphniaGenomics
The Center for Genomics and Bioinformatics (CGB In-
diana University, Bloomington) carries out research in
genomics, bioinformatics and is a principle laboratory
of the Daphnia Genomics Project. This project cre-
ates genomic resources for a developing model organ-
ism in ecological and evolutionary genomics research.
These resources include a 9-fold sequence coverage of
the genome that was produced by the U.S. Department
of Energys Joint Genome Institute in collaboration with
the Daphnia Genomics Consortium. As a result, Daph-
nia will soon have the best characterized genome among
Crustacea and will ultimately be used to address issues
relating to the genome structure of the arthropods.
The CGB has an immediate opening for a Research
Fellow to help create and implement algorithms that
will rigorously test and help improve the assembly of
the genome sequence. The research fellow will also
participate in the exploration and interpretation of the
data. This position is initially funded for one year and
is ideal for investigators who have recently completed
their graduate studies in the ﬁeld of computer science /
bioinformatics, or who are in the ﬁnal stages of complet-
ing their dissertations. However, all candidates with ex-
pertise in computer programming and prior experience24 EvolDir October 1, 2005
with genome sequencing projects are encouraged to ap-
ply, including visiting scientists. We oﬀer a competitive
salary ($57,000 plus beneﬁts) and access to state of the
art facilities.
Speciﬁcally, this project aims to improve the assembly
of the Daphnia genome by developing two computa-
tional methods for detecting misassembled regions, one
based on pattern statistics and another based on clone
coverage statistics. These independent algorithms are
already proven to accurately detect false assemblies in
microbial genome sequencing projects. These two algo-
rithms will be reﬁned and combined to provide a prob-
abilistic support index for scaﬀold junctions and will
function on much larger and more complex eukaryotic
genomes, including Daphnia. A signiﬁcant outcome is
the creation and implementation of a support index
along localized regions of genome sequence assemblies
to indicate regions of high and low conﬁdence.
Applications will be accepted until October 31,
2005. Interested candidates may contact John Col-
bourne for further information (by sending email to
jobs@cgb.indiana.edu). Please submit a CV and a de-
scription of your background and interests, and have
three (3) letters of recommendation sent directly to

ABI AFLPs
Hi all, I have been runing AFLP’s in polyacrilamide gels
in an ABI 377 machine, but recently I have just moved
to a new lab where they have an ABI 3130 capillary
system. No one in the lab have ever used the vapillary
machine for AFLP’s analysis. So we dont have a proto-
col of how to prepare the samples (how much DNA, how
much formamide, etc). Could any one running AFLPs
in capillary systems send me their protocols, and/or
gave me any useful advice? (what to do with the +3
or ﬁnal ampliﬁcation solution before loading it to the
machine). I also was wondering how comparables will
ﬁngerprints runs in ABI 377 to the ones runs in the
capillary system? Or do I have to re-run everything
again in the new machine? Thanks a lot for any help
in this regard Cheers Eloisa

AFLP-ABI answers
Dear All, Thank you, to all of you who responded to my
query regarding how to proceed if switching from a ABI
377 to a capillary sequencer. Here are all responses to
my question and the result of my own experience run-
ning a ﬁrst set of samples this week.
My comments: I used 10um formamide, 0.3 Rox and
0.8 of the +3 solution. I ﬁrst tried with 0.2 and 0.5
ROX and both of them work, but in some cases when
using 0.2 ROX I had a bit fainted signal. So I am using
0.3 and so far is good. I also tried cleaning half of my
samples with sephadex before the run, but it didn???t
make any diﬀerence in terms of the ﬁngerprint signal.
However, some people said that doing it may prolong
the life of the capillary.
I also have another question for people with a lot of ex-
perience scoring peaks. How do you decide what inten-
sity of the peak to use to decide that a peak is actually
a real fragment?
AndI am trying to decide how many primer combs to use for
my study (cost/informative) and I was wondering how
many polymorphic loci is enough to have reliable re-
sults? In my case I am interested in identifying clones
so probably I need more. Any advice? Thanks a lot
again Cheers Eloisa
Answers:
Message 1)
Right now I use capillary sequencer ABI 3100 for AFLP.
To load samples on a sequencer we dilute the product
of selective PCR. Some people do Sephadex cleaning
of the PCR product before they combine it wiuth for-
mamide and Rox. They suggest that by running cleaner
sample you extend life span of the capillary array, but
we don’t do it.
Our protocol: -dilute a product of selective PCR with
pure water (dilution depends on the species but usu-
ally we use 20x dilution) -prepare a mixture of Rox and
formamide for n number of samples: n x 10 ul For-
mamide + n x 0.1 GeneScan Rox 500 -combine 1ul of
diluted PCR product with 10ul Rox/formamide mix -
denaturate 2 min at 92 degrees -cool down on ice -load
the samples to sequencer
And about the comaprison of results from capillary se-
quencers and ABI 377 In the previous project I had a
chance to compare microsatellite patterns on ABI 377
and old capillary ABI 310. I even run PCRs in 2 dif-
ferent labs, run ABI and I got almost identical pro-
ﬁles. Small diﬀerences appeared to be due to taking
peak 250bp in Rox to sizing in one lab but not in the
other! You have to be more careful with AFLP because
there are many more bands but I don’t expect many
diﬀerences in AFLP proﬁles from both sequencers due
to electrophoresis alone. In the proﬁles from ABI 377
sometimes you can observe overﬂow from the neighbor-
ing lanes if you don’t load carefuly. There is of course no
overﬂow in the capillary sequencer. Generally, the pro-
ﬁles should be comparable if the only thing you change
is the sequencer (moving to the new lab you may have
changed also PCR reagents, PCR machines etc etc).
The best way to test it is to take the same PCR prod-
uct and run it on both sequncers. I wouldn’t rerun
everything at once, just test few samples ﬁrst.
Good luck! Regards,
Grazyna

Message 2) We use a bog standard AFLP kit from
Gibco and buy the ﬂuorophore as a custom primer.
This is much more cost eﬀective than buying ABI kits.46 EvolDir October 1, 2005
I load 1ul AFLP ampliﬁcation (1/4 dilution max if you
use G5 dye set)suspended in 9ul HIDI and 20ul per
900ul GS500LIZ or ROX ladder depending on which
dye set you run. I???m afraid I don???t know how
comparable the traces are but I guess you???ll be able
to compare the ﬁngerprints and they???ll be no more
than a 2bp shift. Hope this helps Jake Message 3)
I am also in the process of swapping from running
AFLPS on an ABI377 to the ABI3130. So far I’ve had
a few teething problems so I would be very interested
in the responses you get to your email - could you post
them on evoldir or forward a summary to me?
I use three selective primer pairs that are each labelled
with a diﬀerent dye (FAM, VIC, NED) which I run in
the same lane. I make up a mix using 1ul of each of
the ﬁnal amp PCR products (ie 1ul FAM, 1ul VIC, 1ul
NED products) then use 0.5ul of this mix with 0.5ul of
size standard and 9ul of formamide to be run on the
machine. (The ABI size standards are expensive so I
dilute the size standard 1:5 in formamide to make it
last longer - I’ve also heard people dilute it 1:10 but I
think this is maybe too much). One of the problems
that I have been having is that when my products are
too strong, the capillary is unable to load the sample
properly and I only get fragments up to ~150bp coming
through (I should have products to ~400bp) so I need
to have a play around with diluting my pcr products.
As for comparing genotypes from the 377, I’ve only just
worked out how to get these samples into Genemapper
(the software ABI supply with the machine to analyse
samples) and I haven’t as yet been able to compare the
proﬁles. I’m

information from each population, it doesn’t recognize
that any of the haplotypes are shared. Thanks, Amy

Band puriﬁcation
Dear all, just a trivial question. We are experienc-
ing diﬃculties to obtain good sequences from gel pu-

which protocol to use? Thanks in advance. Lorenzo

Band puriﬁcation answers
Dear all, here ﬁnd the answers that I got to my ques-
tion about how to purify bands from agarose gels for
sequencing on ABI machines.
Original message was: Dear all, just a trivial ques-
tion. We are experiencing diﬃculties to obtain good
sequences from gel puriﬁed bands when using ABI
sequencers, possibly due to carry over of contami-
nants, that result in very high background. Can some-
body give me some hints about which protocol to use?
Thanks in advance.
It seem that many persons did not have any particular
problem with band puriﬁcation, and suggested the use
of the following commercial kits.
1.- “You can use Agarose Newseave (low melting) for
running your PCR product. Then you can use gelase
enzyme. After this you could use the MONTAGE-PCR
column (Millipore). This will remove the potential in-
hibitors. This will be your DNA template for using
at BigDye PCR.” 2.- “You can use Agarose (normal
melting) for your PCR fragment. Then puriﬁed with
GFX Kit (Amersham). And this will be your DNA
template for BD.” 3.- Qiagene columns (3 hits). 4.- “I
have always had good results with centrisep columns
from Princeton Separations. They are spin columns
that are very easy to use. They cost about $2.00 (US)October 1, 2005 EvolDir 47
per column. ” 5.- “We use Promega’s ”Wizard SV gel
and PCR kits“, (then with BigDye v3.1,and run on an
ABI-3100) with good results. I’ve always also had good
results with Qiagen kits too. ”
I also had several message reporting troubles, and
the following suggestions: First, it seems that re-
ampliﬁcation of excised bands using PCR and/or rerun-
ning the sequenceing reaction, can ﬁx the problem. Sec-
ond, two people pointed out that the problem could be
at the sequence puriﬁcation stage, and suggested careful
puriﬁcation of sequence before loading using Sephadex,
or taking care to remove all ethanol before loading if
using alcohol precipitation. Finally, it is suggested to
be careful with high frequency wavelength UV irradia-
tion that can damage the DNA product of your PCR
and result in poor sequencing.
Thanks to all. Lorenzo Zane

Thank you very much for the many replies to my ques-

Several people wisely advised me against forcing un-
treelike data into a tree and I have been getting low
boostrap support at most nodes connecting individu-
als. Their full explanations are below the summary of
“methods” advice that I also received.

Advice against the concept of boostrapping for single
populations: The individual animals have a pedigree.
It is not necessarily treelike (for example, you have two
parents, not just one). I would raise the question of
whether using trees for this is the right thing to do.

I would question the value of bootstrap values for a
single population analyses. Nonetheless, a matrix of
shared allele distances, or any other distance that can
be calculated at the individual level (many msat dis-
tances can not) can be used a some kind of surrogate
for a relatedness index.

hmmm. you might have trouble interpereting results
from a tree. if the pop is inbreeding, there will likeley
be very low bootstrap support for nodes connecting in-
dividuals. for my stuﬀ, i have very well sperated groups,
and still get fairly low bootstrap support (50-60%) even
for interpop groups, and within pops, nodes are com-
pletely unsupported. trees really are very poor ways
to intereperet msat data, particularly within pops, be-
cause they are inherently bad at dealing with geneﬂow.
what exactly are you trying to get at by making a tree?
there may be a more appropriate method...most PIDs
should take into account uncertainty in the estimates...

Cleaning capillars answers
I wrote to evoldir some weeks ago asking about tips for
prolonging the life of capillars in ABI3100 machines.
Here is a compilation of the responses sent to me.
Thank you very much to all who replied.
Cheers, Pablo Orozco
What we usually do is to run a spatial callibration mak-
ing sure that we select the option “ﬁll out” in the spatial
callibration screen. Though, if the capillary has been
in storage for too long and the storage buﬀer has dried
out or was not add to protect the capillary, that array
might be damage already due to dry polymer inside it.
Remember to change the anode buﬀer and the array
buﬀer after you do the procedure. Ricardo
“Ricardo Guerrero” <ricardo@nmsu.edu >
——————– ———————
We always ﬂush the capillaries with clean polymer be-
fore running a plate, especially if the machine has sat
for more than 12 hours without running.
It’s: Instrument >manual control >capillaries >ﬁll.
It seems polymer crystals are the primary reason for
degraded sequences. I don’t know how you would ﬂush
with buﬀer... I would stick with fresh polymer.
Cheers, David Hamm Dept. of Genome Sciences Uni-
versity of Washington
——————– ———————
Dear Pablo: What we usually do is run a Water run
every once in a while, that is supposed to extend the
life of the capillaries. In any case we usually make themlast a lot more than the recommended 100 runs. Good
luck, Andrea

ological Sciences Wellesley College Wellesley, MA 02481
——————– ——————— Theoretically you can
clean the capillars, but we never tried it before. They
(not Applied Biosystems) say that you can clean it with
NaOH liquid, but I don’t know about the concentration.
I would like to try it one day with ClNaO 2% (Sodi-
umHypoChlorid), that’s the detergent we are oxidating
the plates with, to reload them again on the mashine.
Do you know you can regenerate your ABI capillary if
it goes bad? Introducing....
BIOTAQ’s ABI Capillary Regeneration Reagent
If you are using ABI’s capillary electrophoresis systems
(ABI 310, ABI 3100 & ABI 3730) for DNA sequencing
or fragment analysis, chances are after 300 injections,
the capillary will be most likely going bad. Usually as
the number of injections performed on the ABI’s cap-
illary, the resolution and the signal intensity resulting
from the capillary will decline. This is primarily due to
the adsorption of proteins to the wall of the fused silica
capillary.
The resolution for the fragments and peak intensity can
be improved or restored by regenerating the capillar-
ies. The regeneration procedure washes the capillaries
with regeneration reagent. This cleaves the proteins
into smaller fragments, reducing the number of attrac-
tive forces per protein molecule, and therefore reducing
the force with which each molecule binds to the wall of
the capillary. The proteins are then more easily washed
away from the capillary walls. This procedure doesn’t
apply to the capillaries that are irreversibly blocked,
these capillaries will not be restored by the regenera-
tion procedures.
BIOTAQ’s proprietary capillary regeneration reagent
will allow you to regenerate your bad capillary within
5 minutes, it is simple to use and all you need to do
is to rinse the capillary with this reagent, your newly
regenerated capillary is ready for another 1000 more
injections, which will save you lots of money for the
capillary, and what is more is You can regenerate your
capillary for up to three times!
If you are interested in trying our regeneration reagent,
please contact us at services@biotaq.net or visit the fol-
lowing site for ordering information:

Evol bibliography
A few years ago I introduced a big downloadable bib-
liography of about 10,000 references on evolutionary
biology, ecological genetics and population genetics. It
has accumulated over many years as an aid to research,
and to help a book on frequency-dependent selection for
the Oxford University Press. It struck me that others
might ﬁnd the bibliography useful.
I have now updated it (to about 12,000 references). The
bibliography is potentially valuable to others because it
includes many references to papers written before com-
puter searches became established. The ﬁles have the
advantage over the Web of Science (or Google Scholar)
in that they go back before the 1980s, they are much
faster to obtain, and they have already been winnowed
for their evolutionary interest. Many of the recent ref-
erences have abstracts attached.
Please note that the bibliography contains errors and
duplications, and oﬀers no guarantees of accuracy. You
should always check any reference against the original
publication before quoting it.

Extraction kit
Hi Evoldir-members,
In order to keep our extraction costs at an economic
level when running an extraction robot, we are cur-
rently searching for cheap and easy to use extraction
kits (for automated use!). One possibility we are con-
sidering is to duplicate the NucleoSpin tissue kit in our
lab, but we are unable to obtain information on the
buﬀer reagents and their concentrations. Does anyone
use such a protocol or have useful suggestions?

EyeReduction paper
I recently read a paper on lines of Drosophila that had
been kept in the lab for many years, and showed over
that time a slight but signiﬁcant reduction in eye size,
attributed to the possibility that lab-reared ﬂies don’t
need acute vision and selection diverted resources from
eyes to other features. I can’t seem to remember where
the paper appeared–can anyone enlighten me?

Fig FigWasp samples
Dear all,
We have Ficus montana and Ficus septica (around 300
individuals per species) dried leaves and seeds preserved
from the following locations: Indonesian Java, Suma-
tra, and Krakatau islands. Also, pollinators and non-
pollinators (ﬁg wasps) of these two plant species are
preserved in 96% ethanol. For some of the pollina-
tor individuals from the above locations and from the
glasshouse population extracted DNA is available. All
ﬁeld material was collected in spring 2001 (glasshouse
material in 2002 and 2003), documentation about the
locations is kept and it is suitable for DNA extrac-
tions/analyses.
I am afraid, we do not anticipate to work with this ma-
terial shortly and do not have facilities for long-term
storage. I would be happy if this collected material will
be used for further research and therefore, I am oﬀering
you this material. If you (or anyone who you know) are
interested, please contact me as soon as possible.

Floral Emasculation
Dear Member of Evoldir,
I’m writing a book chapter on REPRODUCTIVE
ASSURANCE AND THE EVOLUTION OF UNI-
PARENTAL REPRODUCTION IN FLOWERING
PLANTS, and am in the process of rounding up pub-
lished and unpublished data from natural plant popula-
tions on fruit and seed set by intact versus emasculated
ﬂowers (i.e. ﬂowers that have had their anthers removed
to eliminate autogamous self-pollination).If you have conducted an emasculation experiment of
this sort, I would love to include your results in my re-
view. The data will be collated in a table and ﬁgures.
Your data would only be used in this review, and you
would be duly acknowledged.
If you would like to let me use your data, I need the
following information for EACH population you manip-
ulated.
Species Pollinator(s) Study area Speciﬁc study popula-
tion name Means for each population of: - Mean seed
fertility* of intact ﬂowers (with sample size) - Mean
seed fertility of emasculated ﬂowers (with sample size)
*Fertility might be measured as fruits per ﬂower (i.e.
“fruit set”), seeds per fruit, seeds per ovule (i.e. “seed
set”), seeds per ﬂower (the product of fruit set and seeds
per fruit), or seeds per total ovule (the product of fruit
set and seed set). If possible, I would like all these
measures of fertility, if available. However, I would be
happy to get any data I can (as long as I know what
has been measured).
If you can not provide means for each population, then
fertility measures for each treatment averaged across
populations would still be very useful.
Thank you very much for considering this request, es-
pecially during this busy time of year.
Best wishes,

Guppy Sex
Dear All,
Already as a teenager, I bred aquarium ﬁsh (among
them guppies [Poecilia reticulata]) with great joy, but
then I came to study biology, followed by a Ph-d. in
entomology.
Only by the study of evolutionary biology, it got pos-
sible for me to look through a uniﬁed framework for
the whole of zoology, which even makes it possible to
reconnect to my former teenager guppies.
I now try to conduct simple aquarium experiments with
some 3rd and 4th year graduate students. We hope to
get Guppies from Brazilian Urban River Ecosystems (I
think Guppies are to be found in almost ANY Brazilian
city)
A nice website which introduces into some of the fas-
cinating questions which could be studied with urban
guppies, is the site “Sex and the Single Guppy”:
http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/sex/guppy/
Should you, however, have further suggestions, ideas,
or publications about the evolutionary biology (includ-
ing pop.-genetics) of Guppies (Poecilia reticulata), in
particular Guppies from Urban ecosystems (as they
can be caught with less eﬀort), I would appreciate very
much your feedback and your recommendations!
I would also like to know whether the ubiquity of Gup-
pies came about by intensiﬁed introductions in order
to combat mosquitoes, or whether the Guppies them-
selves, once introduced into only a few places, managed
to reproduce themselves so successfully?
Are there checklists about the world occurrences of
Guppies? Have all the color varieties ever been mapped
and described comprehensively? Or would such an en-
deavor be meaningless? Is it correct that the original
Guppy distribution was limited to Trinidad only?
etc. etc. etc.
Have a nice day!Thomas Schlemmermeyer Universidade Estadual de

Isolation distance altitude
Hey, I have got a question regarding isolation by dis-
tance: I am working with microsatellites and want to
test, if genetic diﬀerentiation is correlated with altitude,
but I have read that this might result in artiﬁcial out-
comes, because there is no theoretical background for
the relationship of Fst and altitude. Is this true and if
yes, how can I deal with this problem in another way?
I would be thankful for suggestions and will post a sum-
mary of answers.

to my question. Hopefully, I have not forgotten a re-

which might be of use in connection to this problem:
Geographical and genetic distances among zooplank-
ton populations in a set of interconnected ponds: a
plea for using GIS modelling of the eﬀective geographi-
cal distance. Michels, E., Cottenie, K., Neys, L., De

tel tests can test for association between any two ma-
trices, so I don’t see any reason why you cannot test
microsatellite data against altitude. Similarly, spatial
autocorrelation does not have to be done with respect
to linear distances - you can make up your own distance
(Gabriel networks allow distance inequalities, eg A– >B
is not the same as B– >A). You might like to have a
look into the ’ecological distance’ literature (eg a paper
by Geﬀen et al in Molecular Ecology in 2004 I think)
which would be a more general approach to the sort of
thing you are probably trying to do. Paul – Dr Paul

environments at higher altitude may cause local adap-
tation (and thus inﬂuence Fst among populations at
lower and higher altitude)? There are some examples
of people working on speciﬁc adaptations (not just neu-
tral variation), but it depends on how much altitude
and on the scale of the organism. Is this not considered
’theoretical background’ by some? Work done by some
researchers on hemoglobin adaptations to high altitude
comes to mind.
On the other hand, ecological changes occurring as you
increase altitude may be expected to result in more sub-
tle changes in populations living in these diﬀerent eco-logical zones, perhaps these ecological changes acting
as soft ’barriers’ to dispersal. This is something we are
working on currently, and we are now testing a method
to measure ’ecological distance’ across mountains (basi-
cally the eﬀect of altitude) on genetic & morphological
diﬀerentiation among populations. Is this something
that interests you? If so, reply to this message and
I can send more information. The work we are doing
won’t be ready for a bit, but we are just at the testing
stage now, and it should not be too long before we can
pass it on if you wanted to try it on your data. If in-
terested drop me a line and I will be happy to explain
this is more detail.

Hi Connie, Although I haven’t done it myself, I know
there are GIS-based methods that will allow you to
measure geographic distance between sites that take
into account elevation. i.e. the straight line distance
between sites on two diﬀerent mountains will be shorter
than the distance you would walk from one site to the
next. Dave David Weisrock, Ph.D.Department of Biol-

Thank you, to all of you who responded to my query

inferring divergence times. It was very helpful to hear
your perspectives, and I was happy to learn that so
many of you share my interest in this topic. Because a
great many people requested that I post the replies, I
have compiled them here (following my signature line).
I hope you will ﬁnd this helpful.

http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/ ˜ csmith/-
ChrisSmith.htm Here are the answers:
Under ideal conditions, the general eﬀect of overspec-
iﬁcation should be reduction of statistical power (ﬂat-
tening of the likelihood surface), while underspeciﬁca-
tion can indeed lead to odd artifacts (being misled).
Also, the cost of overspeciﬁcation in a Bayesian context
should be less than in an ML context because nuisance
parameters (for which the data may be only weakly in-formative) are integrated out. You might look at the
Lemmon and Moriarty paper in Sys Bio a few years
ago, which speciﬁcally investigates the practical conse-
quences of model over and underspeciﬁcation on simu-
lated data, in a Bayesian context.
Hope that helps, D Derrick Zwickl

Hi Chris,
Is there a way to combine information from multiple
genes with diﬀerent mutation rates in R8’s?
As far as I know this cannot be done with r8s right now.
But this can be done with MULTIDIVTIME
Similarly, I am interested in the eﬀect of model pa-
rameters on the behavior of MULTIDIVTIME. The re-
lease notes suggest that the most complicated model
that can be implemented is F84+gamma. Does anyone
have experience using this program for data sets where
more complicated models - say, GTR+I+G for example
- are justiﬁed? What are the consequences of using the
simpler model if the data depart signiﬁcantly from the
expectations of F84+gamma?
I would guess that there is not too much of a prob-
lem with this kind of model misspeciﬁcation. However,
how much of a problem it creates will be related to how
divergent your sequences are, with larger divergences
(corrected distances of 0.5-1+) being most drastically
aﬀected. In my opinion, the most important thing is
to have a rates across sites process, like gamma, in the
model. Even if I+G ﬁts better than G alone, I don’t
think this will matter too much because the invariable
sites end up getting accounted for in the lowest rate
category for the gamma.
Keep in mind I’ve never done the test myself. I
would suggest testing things out by simulating data
under GTR+I+G using Seq-Gen and see how well
ESTBRANCHES/MULTIDIVTIME does at recovering
branchlengths etc using the F84+g model. This is prob-
ably the only decent way to really get an idea of how
bad things could be.
Finally, I strongly suggest you do not use the additive
penalty for r8s. We have good evidence that it causes
serious biases in divergence times.
Sincerely Andrew J. Roger Associate Professor Dept.
of Biochem/Mol. Biol. Dalhousie University Halifax,
N.S. Canada
Dear Chris,
Sorry, I haven’t got an answer to your question, al-
though I am familiar with MULTIDIVTIME. I’d also
be very interested in ﬁnding out whether there is a way58 EvolDir October 1, 2005
to specify a more complex model than F84+gamma.
When too simple a model is speciﬁed, Bayesian anal-
yses (e.g. MrBayes) tend to come up with spurious
results, whereas overspeciﬁcation is usually not a prob-
lem. So that isn’t likely to be any diﬀerent in MUL-
TIDIVTIME. Based on a recent paper in Systematic
Biology (particularly at the ﬁgures on pages 909 and
910 -model underspeciﬁcation vs. overspeciﬁcation).
According to this, MULTIDIVTIME should ideally in-
clude the GTR+I+G model, just to be on the safe side.
I’d very much appreciate if you could keep me updated
if anyone can suggest away how to do this.
Best wishes, Peter “Dr. Peter R. Teske”
<P.Teske@ru.ac.za >
hello Chris, I’ve used multidivtime and it easily does
multiple genes, diﬀerent position partitions. Go ahead
and send Thorne an email, he responds very quickly
and thoughtfully. Curious to see what you hear back,
Chris Christopher West Wheat <cww10@psu.edu >
Well, Multidivtime is a bugger to run, but once you’ve
done it once or a couple of times it is more-or-less
straightforward. When we ran both Multidivtime and
r8s we got fairly diﬀerent results for mean divergence
times for a single data set. I’m attaching a pre-print (in
press - syst biol) which brieﬂy outlines the discrepan-
cies. In future we won;t be using Multidivtime (at least
with its current model implementations) since the F84
model is clearly contradicted by some of our partitions

PCRbands fading
Dear evoldir members,
Alow me to post a technical question, from someone
else in this list. I suspect that someone outthere might
have faced a similar problem before. I would appreciate
very much if I can get some insights from the list about
the following problem:
“I am encountered an extraordinary strange phe-
nomenon agarose gel ethidium bromide staining fading.
Initially I ran my agarose gel in 1 x TAE buﬀer and
stained the gel in ethidium bromide water solution.The images in the gels could last long enough for me
to record the results and take photographes. Suddenly
from my 55th PCR run, the gel once was puton the UV
box, the images in the gel was fading so quickly that it
was not long enough for me to do the necessary record-
ing. What I did was to clean the container and make
up another new solution. This new step would not help
it at all.
Then I switched to 1 x TBE buﬀer, the ethidium bro-
mide solution was made up with 1 x TBE buﬀer as well.
This measure slowered the fading. Again from my 85th
PCR run, the fading is so quick.
Does anyone have this sort of experience? Could you
kindly give me some advice? Or any comments will be
very appreciated!”
Thank you very much for your time.
Cheers,
Fabio

Partial diallel question
Dear EvolDir members,
I used a partial diallel mating design to produce crosses
for a heritability experiment (each of 44 parental plants
were crossed 4x maternally and 4x paternally). I am
currently working with a few people to determine the
best method of analysis. Many of the references we
have found don’t seem to clearly explain how to deal
with the analysis of a design such as mine. It seems
most partial diallel references actually discuss half di-
allel designs, where all possible crosses have been made
without reciprocals or selfs, and do not explain how to
deal with the absence of many possible crosses.
I would appreciate any information on possible anal-
yses for partial diallel mating designs, especially SAS
programming, or good references that may discuss this
type of design.
Thank you,

Reamplify MDEgels
Dear Evoldir,
I am trying to reamplify bands seperated by SSCP-
analysis and am using MDE gels.
Things I tried so far: 1. Cutting out the band and soak-
ing it in water for a couple f hours - overnight; option-
ally followed by a 10min heat (94C) incubation; DNA
was precipitated ethanolically afterwards 2. Stabbing
the band with a 10ul pipette-tip, syringe, respectively,
tranfer of the tip into a fresh PCR reaction, incubation
of tip in reaction for some hours at 4C; alternatively a
syringe was used to stab the band
Stabbing the band with a 10ul pipette tip worked on a
few occasions as the syringe did. However, this tech-
nique seems extremely unreliable. Would you reckon
that I transfer TBE buﬀer into my PCR reaction by
stabbing the gel and, thus, ruin it?
If anyone has a suggestion or experience with a pro-
tocoll for recovery of DNA from MDE, polyacrylamide
gels, respectively, I would appreciate your feedback.

Subtractive Supressive
Hybridization answer
Hi everyone,
About a month ago, I posted a question about SSH
which interested many of you too. Unfortunately, of
about 20 responses I got, all but one were of the kind
“please forward me the ansers you get”. On the other
side, it does show that this technique en vogue. ;)
So, for the beneﬁt of all of you, I post here the full anser
I received. Please do not reply to this mail. ;)
Eric Normandeau
START OF THE ANSER:
I have used the Clonetech kit. To get it to work, I had
to add in an extra hybridization between the tester and
driver (the kit calls for two hybridizations), and I had to
dilute the tester DNA compared to the driver. I ended
up doing the complete protocol three times before I had
good results, not counting repeating particular steps.
“Good” results mean an enrichment for tester-speciﬁc
DNA, so perhaps half of the cloned fragments are really
tester-speciﬁc.
The kit requires a phenol/chloroform extraction, which
was annoying since our lab no longer uses those chem-
icals in routine preps, making a new waste disposal is-
sue. Clonetech couldn’t tell me if it was okay to use
our enzyme stores pre-equilibrated phenol. They sent
me a kit with a bad positive control, which caused me
to use up a lot of reagent with no useful result, but it
took forever to get it replaced since they only made a
new batch once a month. The protocol is a little fussy,
so be sure to read it several times before starting in.
Thats it! Have a good day all

(from 15 days to 6 months) related to the scientiﬁc ob-
jectives of the Programme Please note that the Steering
Committee will fund only suﬃcient high-quality appli-

ConGen invites proposals from potential organisers of62 EvolDir October 1, 2005
workshops to be held in 2006 on topics with a clear
connection to the Programme.
The Steering Committee welcomes all proposals that
fall within the scope of ConGen but is particularly in-
terested in receiving proposals targeted at the following
issues:
1. Use and abuse of molecular genetic markers in con-
servation genetics:
Including questions as: How these markers can be used
to infer population structure, gene ﬂow and demo-
graphic parameters? Can the diﬀerent processes that
lead to similar patterns of genetic structure be distin-
guished? Can they be used to signify causal processes
as habitat change, fragmentation or disturbance? Use
and limitations of (existing) software packages.
2. Level of Genetic variation and the short- and long-
term fate of populations: Causal relationship with ﬁt-
ness, adaptive potential and survival:
Discussing issues as: (i) relevance of neutral genetic
markers versus selective variation; (ii) quantitative vari-
ation versus major genes; (iii) local adaptation versus
plasticity; (iv) local adaptation and gene ﬂow; (v) is
the level of genetic variation a limiting factor?
3. Scaling issues in conservation genetics:
Raising questions as: To what extent can genetic mea-
sures that normally are used to study gene diversity, de-
mography and dispersal at the population and species
level be up scaled to higher levels of biological organi-
sation? Can genetic measures be developed to investi-
gate diversity and its dynamics at the community level?
How is the distribution of biodiversity (across Europe)
aﬀected by diﬀerent spatio-temporal scales and are
standard population genetic processes and approaches
adequate to illuminate this?
Priority will be given to workshops taking place in coun-
tries that ﬁnancially support the Programme (Austria,
Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland,
Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and
Turkey).
ConGen will provide a maximum of 20 000 EUR per
workshop.

We have implemented some major changes with these
databases. We have now generated english descriptions
in HTML format for all grass species which supplement
our current interactive key to grasses. We have included
more documentation and a glossary of terms within In-
tkey, as well as notes regarding individual characters.
There is also useful documentation on the use of the
dataset as well as some Delta and Intkey documenta-
tion. The synonymy database allows you to enter any
grass name and it will give you the accepted name forthat species, as well as a link to the descriptions pages
on the Kew website. In addition to this you can pro-
duce checklists for geographical regions, genera or both,
all with links to descriptions.
These databases are still under development and fur-
ther changes are planned over the next few years.
If any of you ﬁnd anything that you feel you could con-
tribute to these databases in way of corrections or ad-
ditions to our descriptions please see the ’How to make
a contribution’ page on the website.
Enjoy exploring the data and please don’t hesitate to
contact me regarding queries.

Post-doctoral position in evolution and development of
vertebrates 2005/2006
Research Topic: We are mainly interested in (1) how
genes and genomes evolved and (2) what are the links
between gene evolution and phenotype in vertebrates.
We address these questions by means of genetics and
molecular biology performed in model organisms such
as zebraﬁsh, medaka and xenopus. However, we are
also developing studies on non-model species such as
dogﬁsh (chondrychtyans) and lamprey.
Main research projects: - Molecular and functional evo-
lution of gene families : we focused our attention on
evx and dlx genes that encode transcription factors in-
volved in a wide array of developmental processes in
vertebrates. - Evolution of dental structures : compar-
ison of gene networks involved in the development and
evolution of oral/pharyngeal teeth and dermal denti-
cles. - Phylogenomics and genome evolution of verte-
brates. - Web-based storage and analysis tools for gene
expression data.
The post-doc fellow will participate to one of our cur-
rent projects or he can propose a new project concern-
ing the genome evolution and development of verte-
brates. We are particularly interested in a project on
functional analyses of evx and/or dlx genes.

GaterslebenGermany StJohnsWort
A one-year post doctoral position is being funded by
the DAAD ( www.daad.de ) to work in my laboratory
on apomixis evolution in St John’s wort (Hypericum
perforatum).
St John’s wort populations are composed of diploid sex-
ual and/or tetraploid facultative apomictic (asexual re-
production through seed) forms. We are interested in
understanding how and why apomixis has evolved in
Hypericum, and how the expression of apomixis may
be correlated with polyploidy and/or interspeciﬁc hy-
bridization.
We have a large number of wild accessions growing in
our greenhouses, in addition to a number of crosses be-
tween sexual and apomictic genotypes. We are fur-
thermore generating a genetic map using AFLP and
microsatellite markers, and are quantifying variation
in the apomictic phenotype using ﬂow cytometric seed
screens. The post doctoral position would involve the
analysis of microsatellite and SNP markers in the wild
and crossing populations.
My lab is found at the IPK in Gatersleben ( www.ipk-
gatersleben.de ), which is about 2 hours southwest of
Berlin near the beautiful Harz mountains ( http://-
www.nationalpark-harz.de/ ) where you can do lots of
hiking, mountain biking and skiing. The IPK is a very
well funded institute which is composed of a broad spec-
trum of research groups working on many diﬀerent as-
pects of plant genetics.The position is scheduled to start in May 2006.
If you are interested in the position, please don’t hesi-
tate to contact me for more information.

POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATE Com-
putational Statistics in Population Genomics Salary
£22,870- £29,090 inclusive of London Allowance
This appointment is for three years, starting 1 October
2005 (later by agreement)
The post is funded by an EPSRC grant aimed at devel-
oping and applying computational statistics methods
for exploiting the large new datasets that are now aris-
ing in population genomics. Recently, several promis-
ing new methods have arisen that replace calculation of
the likelihood function by a simulation-based approx-
imation, either in a rejection- or importance-sampling
setting, or within Markov Chain Monte Carlo. This is
especially useful when there are a lot of data and models
that are complex yet easy to simulate from. This situ-
ation arises in population genomics, in which genome-
wide datasets from humans and other organisms are
now routinely being collected, and the simulations in-
volve some or all of the demographic history of the un-
derlying population. The post-holder will have oppor-
tunities to explore other application areas, for example
in infectious disease epidemiology.
The postholder’s main tasks will be to develop
and test new statistical methods, guided by the
project leader Professor David Balding, in the Depart-
ment of Epidemiology and Public Health at the St
Mary’s, Paddington, campus of Imperial College, see
www.icbiostatistics.org.uk . S/he will also work closely
with Dr Mark Beaumont, of the School of Animal and
Microbial Sciences at the University of Reading, who
is a collaborator on the project and will be supervising
a PhD student investigating novel applications of the
methodology developed by the postholder.
The successful applicant will have a PhD in computa-
tional statistics or related ﬁeld (statistics, mathematics,
bioinformatics, population genetics, computer science).
The level of appointment will be commensurate with
skills and relevant research experience.

Dear colleagues,
Attached below is a call for postdoc applications for the
Santa Fe Institute. Please pass this on to anyone who
you think might be interested.
The research here is very broad and interdisciplinary,
and the ad has been written to reﬂect that. However, Iwanted to point out some of the work that might specif-
ically interest people with a background in evolutionary
biology.
Current areas of research include ecology, virology and
immunology, evolvability and robustness, population
genetics, genomic imprinting, paleobiology, evolution of
development, genotype to phenotype mapping, biologi-
cal computation and communication, metabolic scaling
relationships, and the origins of the TCA cycle and the
genetic code. The work done here is predominantly
theoretical, but many of these projects incorporate col-
laborations with lab and ﬁeld biologists. For instance,
work done here on the molecular evolution of HIV has
led to a novel strategy for designing vaccines. These
experimental vaccines are currently being tested in the
laboratory, and collaborations are in place for future
clinical trials.
I also wanted to emphasize the real advantage of these
positions: postdocs here are free agents. They can work
on their own projects, or strike up collaborations with
any of the faculty or other postdocs with whom they
have shared interests.
If you or someone you know is a theoretically or compu-
tationally oriented biologist looking for a great postdoc,
check out the website.
Best regards,
Jon Wilkins

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here — Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from ‘blackballed’ addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will onlyOctober 1, 2005 EvolDir 81
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned oﬀ and hence gets only a
once monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf ﬁle.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
‘on vacation’, etc, style messages are automatically ﬁltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope),
but should you wish to avoid the e-mail’s your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word ﬁles, as HTML ﬁles, as L ATEX ﬁles, Excel ﬁles, etc. . . . plain
old ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
“Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:” and then the message stands a better
chance of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and ﬁlters. If the message is caught by one of the
ﬁlters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
Afterward
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
