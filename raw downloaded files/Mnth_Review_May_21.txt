Online BraithwaiteMemorial Apr28
Dear colleagues,
I would like to welcome you to a virtual memorial sym-
posium for Victoria Braithwaite on Wednesday April
28: https://spark.adobe.com/page/5eNmtjPObmuWJ/
This memorial symposium will feature a series of 8 talks
from people in the elds of animal cognition (including
the evolution of) and animal welfare. They are spread
across three continents and ve countries which I think
demonstrates the breadth of Victoria's inuence on the
eld. Most of the speakers worked directly with Victoria
in some capacity and all were heavily inuenced by her
careful and elegant research that was cut short all too
soon.
In addition to these talks, there will be time for people
to share their memories, reections, and thoughts if they
wish.
Please feel free to share widely the website in any way
you wish. You will nd that to actually attend, you
need to click on the \Registration Link" button which
will have you register in Zoom, at which point you will
get emailed a personal Zoom link and the password.

Dear EvolDir members,
We are pleased to announce the coming talk at the
online CIGENE seminar by Kara Layton (University
of Aberdeen) on 14th April 2021 at 12:00-12:50 (Oslo
time). She will talk about: \Using genomics to untangle
marine mimicry systems".
Abstract: Mimicry has evolved multiple times across the
tree of life, it is maintained by both evolutionary and
ecological mechanisms and it contributes to speciation
through the generation of adaptive phenotypic diversity.
While these processes have been extensively studied in
terrestrial taxa, less is known about mimicry in marine
systems. Here, I present a novel mimicry system in a
group of aposematic and toxic nudibranchs (sea slugs)
where multiple polychromatic species have recently been
discovered. I use exon capture data to provide evidence
for multiple scenarios of mimicry evolution in this group
and discuss how future work will look to identify the
genomic basis of mimicry.

Dear EvolDir members,
We are pleased to announce the coming talk at the
online CIGENE seminar.
Date: 5th May 2021 Presenter: Daniel Machado Ti-
tle: Genome-scale models of microbial communities andMay 1, 2021 EvolDir 5
their application to biotechnology
Abstract: From controlling our gut-brain axis to reg-
ulating the planetary geochemical cycles, the role of
microbes in our lives seems endless. Microbes are ev-
erywhere, and they are usually not alone, but rather
operating as part of complex microbial ecosystems. It
thus becomes fundamental to understand how microbes
interact with each other and with their environment.
Next-generation sequencing technologies are shedding a
light on the vast taxonomic and functional diversity of
microbial communities. In this talk, I will discuss how
we are using these data to build genome-scale models
of single species and communities, and how we use such
models to simulate the metabolic phenotype of micro-
bial communities and their response to dierent kinds of
perturbations. These are some of our preliminary steps
towards the design and control of synthetic communities
for application in industrial biotechnology.

Title: Dynamic and descriptive models for spatiotempo-
ral population genomics
Abstract: Ancient genome sequencing provides the op-
portunity to study population genomic processes as they
unfolded in time and space. We can now directly ob-
serve how and when alleles moved across a landscape
over succeeding generations with unprecedented detail.
Here, I will describe several methods developed in our
group to relate these spatiotemporal observations toinformative parameters about migration, admixture and
species ranges. First, I will present new way to model
the spread of ancestry in ancient genomes through time
and space. We have recently applied this method to a
dataset containing thousands of ancient human genomes
and inferred the geographic spread of major population
movements in the past 13 millennia of Western Eurasian
history. Our group has also developed a new dynamic
framework for inferring the diusion of a positively se-
lected allele in a landscape, and a new wrapper to a
forwards simulation framework, which makes it easy
for users to readily gene rate spatiotemporal genetic
processes programmatically. Finally, I will present a
model to jointly infer changes in species distributions,
using a combination of fossil records, sedimentary DNA
data and paleo-climate records. We have applied this
model to an arctic Pleistocene mega-fauna dataset and
demonstrate that incorporating dierent types of data
allows us to evince patterns that would not be visible if
these were studied in isolation.

Online ESEB EvolOfSenescence
Jul6-7
Abstract submissions are invited for 10 min talks and
posters at the online ESEB 2021 satellite symposium:
How have biomarkers improved our understanding of
the evolution of senescence?
6-7 July 2021: talks, 12:30-16:30 CEST; posters, evening
of 6th July
As individuals reach older ages their bodies deteriorate
- a process known as senescence. Individuals within the
same species can dier greatly in the age they start to
senesce, and the rate at which they senesce. However,
why individuals senesce so dierently remains unresolved6 EvolDir May 1, 2021
and is one of the biggest unanswered questions in evolu-
tionary biology. Understanding the drivers of senescence
has important ramications for veterinary medicine, con-
servation, health and society, as it could help individuals
to live longer, healthier lives. This symposium will seek
to address this knowledge gap by bringing together re-
searchers with expertise in senescence from theoretical,
laboratory and eld settings. In particular it will focus
on how our understanding of health and the evolution
of senescence has been altered with the development of
indicators and biomarkers of senescence such as epige-
netic clocks and telomeres. These biomarkers have shed
light on the relative impact of social, environmental,
genetic and trans-generational eects on senescence. A
synthesis of advances in the evolutionary theory of senes-
cence, the occurrence and life-history consequences of
senescence, and the underlying genetic and non-genetic
mechanisms driving variation in individual senescence
will signicantly further the eld. This knowledge is
vital to understanding why senescence has evolved and
how variance is maintained.

Evolution from Populations to Species" hosted by the
Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study during the 19th
- 21st of May 2021, http://www.swedishcollegium.se/-
Symposium5/Symp Home.html 19 - 21 May, 2021
Studies of genome evolution are generally based on two
approaches, phylogenetic methodology that relies on
inter-species variation, and population genetics method-
ology that relies on intra-species variation. The two
approaches, thus, focus on two dierent time-scales, anddierent models and methods have emerged in both
disciplines. Dierent model assumptions have led to
a separation of the two disciplines, and informa- tion
content extracted by each of the two approaches is rarely
combined. However, motivated by the recent increase in
genome sequence data, eorts in method development
have been made to counteract the distinc- tion between
phylogenetic and population genetics methodology.
The idea of this symposium is to discuss and compare
dierent approaches that cross the bridge between inter-
and intra-specic studies. The discussions shall improve
our understanding of the information content provided
in genome sequence data across time-scales and stimu-
late further method development to eciently use the
increasing amount of data available.

Dear all,
The 2021 edition of the MCEB conference will take place
on June 13-17 in Porquerolles, France:
https://mceb2021.sciencesconf.org/ We are aiming at
having a \regular" conference, with all participants
spending a week on the island. Yet, current restrictions
limit the number of attendees to 60. Other restrictions
(e.g., wearing masks, keeping physical distances between
two persons to at least one meter, etc.) will likely apply
too.
*Submissions of posters and/or talks will open the 24th
of March and close the ** **9th of April*. Notica-12 EvolDir May 1, 2021
tion of acceptance or rejection will be sent by the 26th

following day (the 27th of April). Registration fees
(about 500 euros, refundable in case of cancellation of
the event) will cover accommodation plus breakfast,
diner and supper.
The main focus of this year's edition will be on \Climate
Changes and their Impacts on Evolution", in particu-
lar the preservation of biodiversity, the conservation of
species, the study of ecosystems and their dynamics,
and the reconstruction of major past changes of climate
and living conditions on Earth.
We will also welcome contributions dealing with math-
ematical and computational techniques that improved
our understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic. The
design and application of integrative approaches that
incorporate genetic data along with other sources of

AuburnU EvolutionMalaria
I am looking to ll a newly funded PhD assistantship in
the School of Forestry and Wildlife Sciences at Auburn
University, beginning as early as Fall 2021. Research
in the lab is broadly focused on conservation genet-
ics/genomics of wildlife, and typically relies on whole
genome sequencing data and bioinformatic tools. Cur-
rent research the lab includes investigation of the evo-lution of tness in kangaroo rats, understanding the
complexities of population recovery from recent crashes
in Steller sea lions, and developing methods for e-
ciently tracking large populations in terms of census
size and movement patterns in caribou. (Please see
the lab webpage for additional information about on-
going work <http://wp.auburn.edu/willoughbylab/ >.)
PhD students are given a lot of exibility in designing
their research questions. The applicant hired to ll
this position will focus on the evolution of malaria-
transmitting mosquitos in a collaborative project be-
tween the Willoughby lab and Dr. Sarah Zohdy. In14 EvolDir May 1, 2021
some African mosquito populations, treating with pes-
ticides inside family homes has resulted in behavior
shifts where mosquitos now congregate and bite outside
the home. However, we don't know how this behav-
ioral change has manifested in the genome or how these
changes may ultimately alter our ability to control these
populations. Critically, these mosquitos carry malaria,
so control is important! Possible topics include for the
PhD projects in this general research space include:
quantifying genomic adaptation to common mosquito
control measures, modeling of mosquito populations re-
sponses to human activities, genetic determination of
how mosquitos move via water collection, and many
more that could be developed collaboratively. Auburn
University is an R1 institution located in a mid-sized
city in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. Lo-
cal attractions include farmers markets, Auburn City
Fest, and the newly constructed Gouge Performing Arts
Center. The nearby Kreher Forest Ecology Preserve and
Tuskegee National Forest oer additional recreational
opportunities year-round. Successful applicants for this
assistantship will be prepared to take on a new research
project that combines molecular lab work with bioin-
formatics and modeling and perhaps a small amount of
eld work. For interested students, outreach and science
communication opportunities can be made available, in
support of the land-grant mission of Auburn University.
Graduate students in the School of Forestry and Wildlife
Sciences are provided with a competitive stipend and
tuition remission.
Diversity and inclusion are a high priority of this lab
group; all interested applicants are encouraged to get
in touch with me directly prior to applying to the grad-
uate program. To do so, please send me an email
(janna.willoughby@gmail.com) with your background
and interests and a copy of your CV. Although famil-
iarity with bioinformatics and molecular techniques is
desirable for this position, previous experience in this
area is not required. Please do not self-select yourself
out of applying as there are many ways to acquire skills
that will set you up for a successful graduate experience.

PhD in eco-evolutionary dynamics of communities
We invite prospective candidates for a four-year fullyfunded PhD Studentship to explore exciting questions
on the interface of population genetics and community
ecology. How is genetic variation maintained within
populations? And how do species coexist in diverse
communities? These processes are typically studied
separately, but likely interact to structure diversity in
ecological communities. Our collaborative project uti-
lizes a novel experimental community model system of
wild Drosophila species and their parasitoids from trop-
ical Australia. Specically, the candidate could develop
individual based eco-evolutionary dynamics models of
our study system investigating the interactive eect of
genetic variation and species diversity, conduct exper-
imental evolution with the study system, investigate
cellular immunity of Drosophila species in the commu-
nity, or take part in eld surveys.
The successful applicant will join the Laboratory of
Experimental Ecology [ http://lab.hrcek.net ] at the Bi-
ology Centre, Czech Academy of Sciences, Ceske Bude-
jovice, Czech Republic, under the supervision of Dr
Jan Hrcek. The laboratory is a multinational team of
postdocs, PhD students and technicians and the ap-
plicant will have the opportunity to work extensively
with other team members. The laboratory obtained
prestigious high-level funding for ve years from 2020
to 2025 (ERC-CZ grant) and therefore can provide sub-
stantial resources and support for exceptional research.
The laboratory is part of the Department of Ecology, a
dynamic international centre for research on interaction
networks.
Together with the PhD student we will choose a co-
supervisor from current collaborators (listed at the bot-
tom of [ http://lab.hrcek.net/people.html ] page) or
start new collaborations. The position includes a re-
search stay abroad and possibility of eldwork in Aus-
tralia.
The deadline for applications is 6th May 2021, with
interviews on 10th or 11th May. The position can start
from September 2021 onwards. Interested candidates
who could only start in spring 2022 are also encouraged
to get in touch. The student will receive a salary which
comfortably covers living expenses in the Czech Repub-
lic. The working language is English and applicants
from all countries are eligible. A MSc degree is required
to enter PhD in Czech Republic. We are looking for
candidates with:
-||| Experience in eco-evolutionary dynamics or pop-
ulation genetic modelling -||| Experience with pop-
ulation genetics -||| Research experience with labo-
ratory experiments, insect ecology or molecular ecology

algorithms will be aimed at analyzing sedimentary DNA
and microbial DNA. The bioinformatics section of DTU
Health Tech performs research in the areas of dierent
metagenomics, machine learning, cancer genomics and
population genomics.
Current bioinformatics algorithms and software are often
ill-equipped to deal with DNA extracted from ancient
soil samples. This ancient DNA shows high levels of
fragmentation and accumulated chemical damage. Fur-
thermore, ancient sediments often contain DNA from
multiple species and often multiple individuals. Fortu-
nately, several problems pertaining to ancient DNA can
be described in a maximum-likelihood framework and
computer science techniques can help us to solve such
numerical problems eciently via numerical algorithms
and data structures. You will work in collaboration with
other partners including the University of Copenhagen
and McMaster University in order to develop the next
generation of algorithms and software applied to DNA
extract from fossils, ancient soils and sediments.
Given the COVID19 pandemic, we will happily accom-
modate requests for remote work until in-person work
is deemed safe.
Applicable for all scholarships
Qualications You must have a two-year masters degree
(120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic
level equivalent to a two-year masters degree. Ideally,
your degree should be in computer science, mathematics
or biological science with a focus on quantitative and

Iceland BirdEcologicalGenomics
Ph.D. studentship in Rock ptarmigan ecological ge-
nomics at the University of Akureyri, Iceland
We???re seeking a highly motivated Ph.D. student to
work on a fully funded project on genomics and ecol-
ogy of rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta) in Iceland. The
project is funded for 36 months, starting in June 2021.
The project Ecological genomics encompasses ecology,
genomics and evolutionary biology, and utilizes genomic
approaches to address consequential ecological questions.
In this project we will apply an ecogenomic approach,
by analysis of genome diversity and gene expression, as-
sessing the association of genetic variants to population
cycling or intermediate phenotypes of rock ptarmigan.
Within the frame of the recently completed comprehen-
sive project, ???Rock ptarmigan health and population
change??? spanning the years 2006-2018, a unique tissue-
, and dataset have been created by the annual collection
of data on this wild bird population. We aim to explore
the impact of trophic interactions such as diversity of the
gut microbial community, plant-herbivore interactions,
and the role of toxins. The health parameters and tissue
collection of Icelandic rock ptarmigan are unique with
no such comparable dataset available elsewhere. To con-
vey ecogenomic approach we will generate genomes and
transcriptomes from the rock ptarmigan to carry out
our comparative genomics and tissue-specic expression
analysis with the goal to map and characterize genomic
regions involved in selection/adaption and to examine
how genes are involved in various biological processes
such abiotic and biotic stress responses.
The main supervisor of the PhD student will be Profes-
sor Kristinn P. Magn??sson at the Faculty of Natural
Resource Sciences, Universtity of Akureyri (UNAK) and
Icelandic Institute of Natural History (IINH). Other ad-
visors are Professor Jacob H??glund at the Instititute
of Ecology and Genetics, University of Uppsala, Swe-
den. Professor Sn??bj??rn P??lsson, Faculty of Life
and Environmental Sciences, University of Iceland, As-
soc Professor Eva Charlotte Halapi Faculty of Natural
Resource Sciences, UNAK and Professor Jennifer For-
bey Dep. of Biological Sciences, Boise State University,
Boise, USA. The bulk of the work will be carried out at
the UNAK/IINH laboratories in Akureyri, but the stu-dent will also attend secondments in Uppsala, Sweden.
The role of the doctoral student In accordance with
the rules and regulations for doctoral studies at the
University of Akureyri, the student will prepare and
submit their own study plan, and otherwise submit to
the obligations and attain the rights of doctoral stu-
dents at UNAK. The doctoral studies will conclude
with the public defense of a Ph.D. thesis consisting of
peer-reviewed publications in internationally recognized
academic journals.
Qualications A successful applicant will have a rst-
class M.Sc.-degree or equivalent in a relevant eld, such
as genomics, bioinformatics, evolutionary biology or
molecular genetics. The applicant will furthermore have
a genuine, interest in science, as well as a willingness
to learn new methods of research and excellent inter-
personal and collaborative skills. Excellent reading,
writing, and communication skills in English are an
absolute must.
Application process Applications for doctoral student
positions at the University of Akureyri are twofold.

PlantEcologicalGenomics
Funded PhD position available at Idaho State University
in plant ecology and genomics!
We are looking for a PhD student and future collaborator
to join our team on a recently-funded project investi-
gating the ecological impacts of ploidy and genome size
variation in the iconic foundational species, big sage-
brush (Artemisisa tridentata). This student will be
involved in a large and collaborative network of trans-
disciplinary scientists and stakeholders across Idaho as
part of the NSF/Idaho EPSCoR GEM3 project (see
idahogem3.org for more information on this state-wide
initiative). The PhD student will be co-advised by
Dr. Josh Grinath (https://jbgrinath.wordpress.com/)
and Dr. Kathryn Turner (kathryngturner.com) in the
Department of Biological Sciences at Idaho State Uni-
versity (isu.edu/biology). The student will be supported
on a research assistantship for two full years (tuition is
waived, and there is guaranteed summer funding and no
TAing during that time). After that, the student will
transition to a teaching assistantship or other funding
support. This work represents 1-2 chapters of the stu-
dent's dissertation; the student will develop additional,
perhaps related, projects for the rest of their dissertation
work.
The project:
Ploidy level and genome size are genetic traits that
greatly inuence the performance of phenotypes in eco-
logical communities. In particular, organismal demands
for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are expected to
increase with genome size because genetic architecture
requires larger amounts of these resources than other
biomolecules. As N and P have limited availability
in most natural systems, these demands translate into
stronger limitation in the performance of polyploids vs.diploid relatives. In plants, restrictions on polyploid
performance may be even more severe for species that
are co-limited by both N and P supply. Co-limitation
occurs when plant access to one resource is impeded
by the lack of another resource, and performance only
improves greatly when multiple resources are simultane-
ously available. In addition, water availability can aect
plant access to N and P, and co-limitation may occur
among all three of these resources. Though resource co-
limitation is common for plants, it is currently unclear
how ploidy level and genome size aect the strength of
co-limitation and plant competitive ability across vari-
ous resource environments. Moreover, it is unclear how
these resource relationships aect the spatial distribu-
tion of individuals within and across populations. In this
project, we will study the eects of ploidy level, genome
size, and resource availability (N, P, and water) on the
performance of big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata s.l.).
Focusing on the establishment life-history phase, we will
use greenhouse and eld experiments to evaluate how
these factors aect sagebrush resource requirements, co-
limitation, competitive ability, and spatial patterning.
To apply:
If interested, please contact Dr. Grinath (grin-
josh@isu.edu) and Dr. Turner (turnkat2@isu.edu) as
soon as possible. For more information on applying,
please see the Department of Biological Sciences at ISU
( isu.edu/biology/degree-programs). Ideally, this posi-
tion would begin August 2021.

PhD Student position in Population genomics of out-
breaks - one week left to apply!
We are seeking a motivated PhD Student to join the
project \Genomics of population outbreaks in an emerg-
ing model system - neutral and adaptive evolution in
the spruce bark beetle", funded by the Polish National
Science Centre (NCN) SONATA BIS grant.
About the project
A major goal in evolutionary biology is to understand
which processes shape genetic diversity observed in nat-
ural populations. Classic population genetic theoryMay 1, 2021 EvolDir 19
provides a solid mathematical framework to study ge-
netic variation and predict ecacy of natural selection
relative to drift in equilibrium conditions, for example
under constant population size. However, the majority
of natural populations often experience large size uc-
tuations that make prediction less straightforward. The
main purpose of this project is to test how extreme uc-
tuations in population size of outbreaking species aect
the dynamics of neutral and adaptive genetic variation.
Many pests experience epidemic outbreaks characterized
by sudden changes in population size, often spanning
orders of magnitude. Such outbreaks are known from
ecological studies of closely monitored species of eco-
nomic importance. However, little is known about how
genetic variation changes during outbreak cycles. Specif-
ically, the rate of adaptive evolution during relatively
short periods of large population size remains unknown.
This can be studied in species which experience extreme
uctuations of population size, such as spruce bark bee-
tle (Ips typographus). Spruce bark beetle is the most
destructive pest of Norway spruce forests because under
specic conditions (e.g. storms) populations may out-
break, causing mass mortalities of spruce stands. We
will compare populations of spruce bark beetle that
have experienced frequent, recent outbreaks and popu-
lations that did not experience outbreaks in the recent
past. By combining existing knowledge on biology and
ecology of the species with newly generated, large-scale
genomic data, we will address specic questions about
the relationship between genome-wide variation and uc-
tuating eective population size: How outbreaks aect
species genetic structure? Are adaptations in frequently
outbreaking populations mainly driven by soft sweeps?
How demographic history of the spruce bark beetle and
historical uctuations of eective population size over
time aect current patterns of neutral and adaptive
variation and more.
The PhD student will be working with large, whole
genome resequencing data obtained from several pop-
ulations and >500 individuals (short and linked-read
sequencing). Part of the sequencing data is already avail-
able. The PhD student will investigate selection patterns
along the spruce bark beetle and among outbreaking
and non-outbreaking populations. The analysis will in-
clude standard selection scans as well novel approaches
to detect and distinguish between hard and soft sweeps.
The PhD student will gain a wide range of scientic ex-
perience including genome-wide sequence data analysis
as well as wet lab practice and will be encouraged to
develop his/hers own projects using extensive datasets
available.
About the place and salary
The student will be based at one of the top research in-stitutes in the elds of Ecology and Evolution in Central
Europe - Institute of Environmental Sciences, Jagiel-
lonian University, Krakow, Poland ( www.eko.uj.edu.pl/-
enGB). Krakow is a beautiful city with a dynamic cul-

festivals and other events organized every year; modern
museums, cinemas, theaters, restaurants etc). It has
good access to outdoor activities (biking, hiking and
more) and is well-connected to the rest of Europe.
The PhD student will be supported by a 48-month,
tax-free research stipend: 4500 PLN ( ~1000 EUR) per
month. This stipend may be combined with the stan-
dard PhD program scholarship (for those that will pass
the entrance exam to PhD graduate school at Insti-

MicroEukaroyteEvolution
Graduate Assistantship(s) in Microbial Eukaryotic Evo-
lution, Ecology, and Genomics
**May 1, 2021 EvolDir 21
The Brown lab (http://amoeba.msstate.edu) seeking
potential graduate students (M.S. or Ph.D.) interested
in studying evolution, ecology, and/or comparative ge-
nomics of amoeboid protists.
The Brown lab is broadly interested in the evolution,
ecology, and genomics of microbial eukaryotes. We are
currently funded through a multiyear US National Sci-
ence Foundation project through the PurSUiT category,
which is \meant to encourage biodiversity discovery and
description in poorly known, or dark areas, of the Tree
of Life."
The project title is \PurSUiT: Sampling amoeboid pro-
tists as a reservoir of unknown/undescribed eukary-
otic diversity" and more information on this project
can be found at https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/-
showAward?AWD ID!00888 Generally, the Brown lab
examines the deep evolution of eukaryotic lineages. We
are using novel approaches in phylogenomics to examine
how the various major groups of eukaryotes evolved over
the course of the last 2 billon years. However, we are
currently most focused on the evolutionary histories of
amoeboid organisms.
The Brown lab is also developing model systems to look
at the commonalities among the greatest examples of
convergent evolution known to date. We have discov-
ered that a great diversity of single celled eukaryotic
microbes (AKA protists) are capable of working with
one another to form a complex body made of thou-
sands of individual cells. This is one of the simplest and
most striking examples of emergent behavior. In many
cases, this behavior is sacricial where some of the cells
that become part of the multicellular body die for the
\greater good" of others. To examine the commonali-
ties amongst the various social protists, we are taking
a multi-pronged approach using comparative genomics
and developmental transcriptomics to elucidate the ge-
netic basis of sociality. Aspects of this project may also
be pursued by new graduate students.
**
Funding for students will be provided through NSF
funded research assistantships with some semesters
of teaching assistantships within the department so
that graduate students can gain formal teaching ex-
perience. I will also provide a summer salary. Informa-
tion on Graduate Studies in the Department of Biologi-
cal Sciences is available at http://biology.msstate.edu/-

ExtinctionHistoricalDNA
PhD Studentship in population genetics - Using a ge-
netic time series and historical DNA to understand
extinction risk
A fully-funded 3-year PhD studentship is available at
the French National Museum of Natural History in Paris
(MNHN), working closely with the CAGT ancient DNA
lab at the University of Toulouse. The student will
be supervised by Ben Warren (Principal Supervisor),
Guillaume Achaz and Stefano Mona.
The PhD is part of a wider project on birds (Suscept-
Ext) funded by the French National Research Agency
(ANR) aimed at understanding the role of evolutionary22 EvolDir May 1, 2021
history in determining why some species are threatened
with extinction, while others are at comparatively little
risk.
Co-investigators are Ludovic Orlando, Catherine Th eves,
Loun es Chikhi and Eric Crub ezy at the University of
Toulouse, and Julian Hume at the Natural History Mu-
seum, London.
Details of the project:
Evolutionary history is expected to play a major role
in determining which species decline in population size
to extinction in response to environmental change, but
the processes by which this comes about are poorly un-
derstood. Although population genetic studies provide
much promise to understand the microevolutionary pro-
cesses behind macroevolutionary patterns of extinction
risk, inferences can be limited by our condence in the
timescales inferred, and by the scale of such studies,
which frequently include only one lineage. The PhD
student will tackle both of these issues, applying popu-
lation genetic methods to a genome-wide time series for
multiple Mascarene island bird lineages that dier in
abundance and other biological traits. The student will
help develop the time series which will contain not only
modern DNA but also historical DNA from museum
samples (historical and subfossil).
Islands in the Mascarene archipelago (Mauritius &
R eunion), Indian Ocean, are unusual among sizable and
biologically diverse landmasses worldwide, in that they
had no human population until European arrival 400
years ago. For birds, there exist museum samples and
subfossils spanning the full duration of anthropogenic
environmental change, allowing a real-time assessment
of genetic response to environmental changes of known
timing and across multiple species following rst human
presence.
The student will be in charge of population genetic
analyses aimed at making inferences of selection, and
comparing selective responses to common (and severe)
environmental changes across multiple species that dier
in abundance - common species versus rarer ones (most
of which are IUCN threatened). Another aim is to test
the signicance of correlations between the timing of
genetic and environmental changes. The student will
work alongside a postdoc (Alexander Verry) with ex-
perience in ancient DNA lab techniques, and who will
be focussed on demographic analyses for the same time
series. It is expected that the student will help generate
the genetic time-series, with guidance in the lab from
the postdoc. Furthermore, there is much potential for
the student to contribute to demographic analyses or
method development, in collaboration with the postdoc.
Such demographic analyses should be used to informinferences of selection.
We are looking for a highly-motivated student with: -
rst-rate academic credentials in population genetics in
particular, - a strong interest in the broad theme of the
study - understanding the role of evolutionary history
in determining which species decline towards extinction
in response to environmental change.
A minimum requirement is to have obtained excellent
grades in a substantial (Undergrad and/or Masters)
course(s) in population genetics. Experience in popu-
lation genetic or genomic analyses in previous research
projects would be ideal. Other elds particularly rele-
vant to this project are Evolutionary Biology (ideally a
broad background and interest), Conservation Biology,
Mathematics or Bioinformatics.
The student will be based at the MNHN (Mus eum Na-
tional d'Histoire Naturelle, UMR ISYEB CNRS), which
is a renowned centre for biodiversity research and col-
lections in the heart of Paris. S/he will also spend 4
months of their rst year in a globally leading ancient
DNA lab in the south of France (UMR CAGT, CNRS-
University of Toulouse) for the wet lab component of
their thesis.
Start date: December 2021 or January 2022
Applications should ideally be submitted by May 19th
(deadline: May 31st).

sea ice cover is overwhelming. The PhD fellowship will
integrate palaeogenomics, palaeoecology, and palaeocli-
matology to elucidate how climatic perturbations have
aected the ranges and abundances of Arctic marine
mammal species in the past.
The PhD project aims to retrieve ancient mammalian
DNA from marine sediments and subfossil remains
of Arctic marine mammal species to document their
occurrence and diversity throughout the Late Pleis-
tocene/Holocene. The DNA data will be combined
with other proxy data on the timing and magnitude of
changes in the abundance and species composition of
organisms at the base of the food web (e.g. phytoplank-
ton, sea ice algae, zooplankton), to investigate how past
patterns of climatic shifts have impacted species, with
the ultimate goal of improving our understanding of
how these species might fare in the near future of in-
creased global warming under dierent future scenarios
of climate change.
The PhD fellow will be supervised by Associate Profes-
sor Eline Lorenzen and co-advised by Senior Researcher
Soa Ribeiro at the Department of Glaciology and Cli-
mate, Past Climate and Environments Research Group,

PhD position in Ancient DNA Bioinformatics
Statistical and Computational Biology Group (Daniel
Wegmann) University of Fribourg, Switzerland
**Who we are** We are a young, international, interdis-
ciplinary and enthusiastic research group at the Univer-
sity of Fribourg, Switzerland, aiming at understanding
the evolutionary and ecological processes shaping the
realm of biological diversity we see today. To achieve
this, we design and develop new statistical and compu-
tational approaches, and apply them to big data from
many biological elds. A current focus of the lab is on
dedicated tools for ancient DNA (aDNA) bioinformatics
and their use to study past human societies.
**Your tasks** We develop ATLAS (https://-
bitbucket.org/wegmannlab/atlas), a dedicated tool to
conduct bioinformatic analyses from raw-sequence data
to population genomics. We seek a highly motivated
PhD student to extend the machine learning models
of ATLAS that are used for genotyping, in particular
regarding post-mortem damage and recalibration, and
to support the analysis of ancient DNA data within
larger consortia.
The position is fully funded with a competitive salary
for three years, with the possibility to extend by one
additional year. The successful candidate should ideally
start in Summer 2021. The project does not involve lab
work, unless specically desired by the candidate.
**What we oer** We oer a stimulating research envi-
ronment, well embedded in the strong bioinformatic and
conservation communities in western Switzerland. We
are part of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB)
and boost excellent research facilities, including state-of-
the-art high-performance computational infrastructures.
Fribourg is a lively university town with pleasant sur-
roundings (such as the Alps) and an excellent quality
of life. It is located only 20 minutes from the capital of
Switzerland, Bern, and just a little over an hour from
Geneva and Z urich. While some knowledge of German
or French is benecial for living in Switzerland, it is not
essential. The working language in our lab and institute
is English.
**What you bring** You should have a master degree
in bioinformatics, computational biology, computer sci-ence, statistics or a related eld, and a strong interest
in applying these skills to bioinformatics. While a plus,
experience in programming is not strictly required. But
we expect candidates to be highly motivated to acquire
skills in programming and statistical inference, for which
we are happy to provide state-of-the-art training. Good
knowledge of written and spoken English is expected.
**How to apply** To receive full consideration, apply
before May 15 at https://forms.gle/7ehFod3uo59CizNx8

(July 1, 2015) with the purpose to achieve the vision
of \A University with marine research, teaching and
cooperation of the highest international class" (https:/-
/www.gu.se/en/marina-vetenskaper) . The department
has about 110 employees - researchers, teachers, PhD
students, technicians and administrators. The depart-
ment carries out teaching and research in the various
marine specializations, biology, oceanography, chemistry,
marine geology, conservation of underwater cultural her-
itage, and environmental science. The Department is
situated in Gothenburg and at the University's research
stations at Tj arn o and Kristineberg. This position is
placed at the Tj arn o Marine Laboratory, a stimulat-

Project description We have one PhD position available
to work on the new research project funded by the re-
search council FORMAS \Genetic population structure
of Baltic Sea eelgrass - urgent information for conser-
vation of a foundation species under climate change".
Biodiversity loss and climate change are two of the
grand challenges of our time. Maintaining biodiversity,
within and between species and ecosystems, will become
increasingly important to avoid the worst impacts of
climate change. Despite the fact that genetic diversity
is the level where natural selection and evolution of
new adaptations aect individual and species survival,
genetic diversity is rarely considered in environmental
conservation.
The seagrass Zostera marina (eelgrass) is one of the most
important habitat-forming species along northern tem-
perate coasts world-wide, as well as around the Swedish
coast. Eelgrass meadows have declined considerably
and are at risk of further decline due to climate change,
not least in the Baltic Sea. To mitigate further losses,
genetic diversity must be taken in to consideration when
developing management plans. This is clearly demon-
strated by our earlier work showing a surprising genetic
complexity of eelgrass on the Swedish west coast. Focus-
ing on the Baltic Sea, we will use I) genomics to provide
a baseline of current genetic diversity and connectivity
for future genetic monitoring of Baltic eelgrass and to
explore local adaptation; II) oceanographic modelling
of current and future climate scenarios, useful for prior-
itizing meadows for protection and restoration; and III)
demographic modelling to assess meadows' ability to re-
cover and adapt in the future. We encourage applicantsthat are keen to develop their own research within and
beyond the above described project.
We are seeking an independent and collaborative per-
son with a background in population genetics/genomics
to pursue PhD studies in Marine Sciences. The PhD
project will focus on population genomic assessments
of a seagrass in the Baltic Sea to provide a baseline
for future temporal conservation genetic monitoring of
eelgrass in Sweden. Investigating into local adaptation,
genetic demographic modelling and species distribution
modelling can then help to address persistence and
adaptation potential under predicted climate change.
The research project itself is very collaborative and will
involve collaboration with international and Swedish
researchers.
Job assignments The main task is to conduct a PhD
thesis under supervision within the research theme de-
scribed above. Techniques used within the project in-
clude: molecular lab skills (DNA extractions, PCR, li-
brary preparation, gel electrophoresis etc), bioinformatic
skills for genomic data analysis, statistical analyses, writ-
ing of scientic articles and dissemination of scientic
results at both international and national conferences
and seminars. There will also be opportunities for eld
work and mesocosm experiments.

ULethbridge BeetleMicrobiome
A MSc position is anticipated starting September,
2021 to study the gut microbiome of carabid beetles
(Coleoptera: Carabidae).About 400 species of carabid beetles form an abundant
and diverse assemblage in agricultural systems through-
out the Canadian Prairies. Most of these species are
considered benecial by virtue of being parasitoids or
predators of pest insects, or by feeding on weed seeds.
The taxonomy, distribution and life-history for most
of these beetles is well-known, and large numbers of
specimens can be readily collected with use of pitfall
traps. Because of these features, carabid beetles have
been extensively studied as biological indicators of envi-
ronmental change.
The gut microbiome of insects plays a critical role in the
breakdown and assimilation of food items by the host.
Factors that aect the microbiome (e.g., diet, chemical
residues, temperature) can inuence the survival and
reproduction tness of the host and the ecosystem ser-
vices that they provide. Few studies have described the
gut microbiome of carabid species.
The proposed research will use next generation sequenc-
ing methods to compare the gut microbiome of selected
carabid species representing dierent trophic levels (e.g.,
parasitoid, predator, seed-feeder) under dierent con-
ditions such as diet, crop type (e.g., cereal, oilseed),
and exposure to agricultural chemicals (e.g., herbicides,
fungicides). Results will describe the core microbiome
of these species and their resilience to abiotic and biotic
factors.

Dear all
Sorry for possible cross posting. Please distribute as
appropriate.
This is to inform you about a PhD project on
\Resisting climatic stress due to genetically or phy-
logenetically distant neighbours: from the tree to
the forest". The project is one out of 4 for in
our research unit competing for 2 fundings. The
project is supervised by Andreas Prinzing (links below),
Matthew Potts (https://nature.berkeley.edu/pottslab/
) and Freerk Molleman (https://www.researchgate.net/-
prole/Freerk-Molleman). Note the multiple-step appli-
cation procedure indicated below.
## The project: The climate is becoming increasingly
hot and dry in most of Europe, which threatens forest
trees: the plasticity or resistance of their seasonal phe-
nology is insucient in the face of climate change. As
a consequence, the forest ecosystem is neither resistant
nor resilient to current climate change. To deal with
this problem, foresters are trying to adapt forests by
planting tree species or genotypes that are more resis-
tant to future climatic conditions. These species and
genotypes are introduced from warmer and drier regions.
However, introductions of new species or genotypes risk
to trigger biological invasions. Management strategies
favoring the resistance or resilience of native genotypes
and species are needed. We propose such strategies,
taking into account the interactions between trees via
the natural enemies shared among trees, in particular
among evolutionarily closely related trees. The work
therefore contributes to an evolutionary ecology of the
forest ecosystem, applied to management under climate
change. The work will prot from the analysis of ma-
jor databases of long-term observations and common
garden experiments.
## Scientic and technical skills required by the candi-
date: Knowledge of ecology, evolutionary biology, plant-
animal interactions, or forestry. Knowledge of data
processing and quantitative analysis. Driving license.
## Net salary ca. 1400 Euros/month for three years.
Contract as employee, i.e. with health insurance etc..## The host lab here is the Research Unit ECOBIO -
Ecosystems, Biodiversity, Evolution, co-funded by Uni-
versity of Rennes 1 and Centre National de la Recherche
Scientique. See
http://ecobio.univ-rennes1.fr/ . Ecobio was ranked A in
the national evaluation of research institutions. Several
further research institutions in ecology and evolutionary
biology exist at Rennes.
## The location: Rennes has approximately 200
000 inhabitants and is the capitol of the Bre-
tagne region with exceptional coastal and mainland
landscapes, and a french-celtic heritage (https://-
www.brittanytourism.com/). It is situated some 1.5
hours by train from Paris. English is spoken everywhere
in academia, but not necessarily by everybody outside.
Like in any French city, child care is excellent (almost for

PtarmiganPopulations
Two (2) PhD or MS Assistantships in Ecology to Study
White-tailed Ptarmigan Population Processes (Demo-
graphics and Genomics)
We are recruiting two graduate students to study white-
tailed ptarmigan population dynamics in the southern
Rocky Mountains of Colorado. This research is part of
a continuing long-term study of two ptarmigan popula-
tions (Mt. Evans and Trail Ridge [Rocky Mountain NP])
that began in 1966. The rst student (Demographic)
will investigate habitat relationships by combining newly
collected VHF-telemetry data with an existing location
database and applying resource selection functions to
model quality habitats, and predict likely future changes
to habitat under various climate scenarios. This stu-
dent will also conduct eld work to monitor breeding
activities during the spring and summer, and construct
population models used to estimate various demographic
rates and processes. The second student (Genomic) will
have access to a full genetic catalog of biological sam-
ples collected from every banded white-tailed ptarmigan
captured within the past 15 years, with associated re-
peated measurement data on timing of breeding events
(for females) and demographic data. This student will
potentially conduct paternity analyses, and relatedness
matrices for use in animal models to evaluate the adap-
tive nature and evolvability of timing of breeding and
molt. This student will also participate in the collection
of eld data. There will be considerable freedom for
both students to develop their own research program, so
long as they align at least somewhat with these research
topics.
Those interested in applying for a PhD assistantship
must have a MS degree in wildlife biology, ecology, statis-
tics, or a closely related eld. We prefer to hire PhD
students for both positions, but will also consider out-
standing students with a bachelor's degree given they
have demonstrated eld and research/quantitative expe-
rience. Please make sure to highlight such experience in
your cover letter. Ideally, students will be available to
begin eld work in late-May or June of 2021, and begin
taking classes in the fall (mid-August) of 2021. There
may be some exibility in this start date, but coursework
must begin in August. Please specify which position
you are applying for in your cover letter, what skills youhave that would make you ideal for this position, and
why you could be a good candidate.
Required Qualications:
* MS (PhD applicants) or BS (MS applicants) in wildlife
biology, statistics, or related eld * Excellent written
and oral communication skills * Excellent organizational
skills * Ability to work independently in rugged and
sometimes isolated wilderness * Demonstrated course-
work in statistics, population genetics, or demographic
modeling (MS) * Demonstrated research thesis or pub-
lications (PhD)
Desired Qualications:
* Strong quantitative skills, including Bayesian hierarchi-
cal modeling, mark-recapture analyses, or generalized
linear models * Experience coding in R or Python, in-
cluding GIS spatial processing * Knowledge of avian
biology or alpine ecosystems

Most of the interactions between a pathogen and its host
arise during the infection, when pathogens proliferate
inside the host. These interactions have shaped both
the evolution of our immune system and that of the
pathogens which infect us. The main goal of the project
is to study the within host dynamics of a pathogen to
better understand these selective pressures.
It may seem relatively easy to measure the immune
response of a host: immune cells can be counted, an-
tibodies can be quantied, the expression of immunity
genes can be assessed, etc. But all these molecular mea-
surements are usually restricted to a part of the immune
response (e.g. the expression of a small number of im-
munity genes are measured) and do not really tell what
eect it has on pathogens. As such, these measurements
do not describe the interaction we are interested in.
If we are to really understand how immunity works, we
rather need to describe its eect on pathogens, while tak-
ing into account all possible types of immune responses
and their respective regulation. Recent experimental
work has shown that it is possible to study in details the
dynamics of bacterial pathogens inside the experimental
host Drosophila melanogaster, and that this dynamics
reveals some aspects of the global immune response of
the host.
The aim of the PhD is:1/ to design and study mathematical models that de-
scribe the intra-host dynamics of a pathogen in order
to better understand what it reveals of its interaction
with the immune system of its host;
2/ to develop methods (e.g. maximum likelihood) that
will allow to adjust the model on experimental measure-
ments of within-host pathogen dynamics;
3/ to use these tools to study how the host resists or
tolerates infectious diseases;
4/ to integrate the models in an evolutionary perspective,
with the possibility for example to study how pathogens
will evolve depending on the defense strategy the host
uses.

**Ph.D. student position in molecular evolution**
Are you intrigued by the still elusive link between
genome evolution, natural selection, and species adap-
tation? Then, this Ph.D. position and excellent Ph.D.
program might be a good t for you:
Topic: Molecular evolution of coding sequences
Advisors: Rui Borges (Vetmeduni Vienna) and Carolin
Kosiol (University of St. Andrews)
Description: A major goal in evolutionary biology is to
understand the forces that operate in the genomic se-
quences and are responsible for the adaptation of species
to dierent environments. Codon models are one of the
main tools used to infer selection on protein-coding
genes. These have been popularized in comparative
genomic studies by their extensive use in genome-wide
scans of natural selection. However, current models of
codon evolution have signicant limitations that are
increasingly being recognized. The main one being
that current codon models make simplistic assumptions
about the evolutionary process: e.g., uctuating de-
mography and GC-biased gene conversion. This Ph.D.
project seeks to develop a new codon evolution model to
detect signatures of natural selection on protein-coding
sequences. By properly reconciling the neutral and
adaptive processes by which coding sequences evolve,
the models and methods developed in this project will
allow us to tell apart the sole action of natural selec-
tion from known confounding forces. This project will
ultimately contribute to better understanding the dy-
namics of adaptation during species divergence. More

Prole: The project is particularly well-suited for stu-
dents with a keen interest in computational biology,phylogenetics, or population genetics. Prior experience

You will contribute to the development of methods and
software for genome data QC and assembly. Sequenc-
ing technologies are constantly evolving in terms of the
type and volume of the sequence data they produce.
The recent progress in long-read sequencing technolo-
gies means that we are now able to eciently deliver
high quality genome assemblies for species that did not
previously have such a resource. We will produce thou-sands of genome assemblies for symbiotic organisms,
and analyse these to understand their biology.
You will have previous experience with genome bioinfor-
matics or other large-scale scientic data analysis, or a
newly qualied graduate student with data science skills
interested in assembling DNA sequence data. While de-
sirable, previous experience with DNA sequencing data
is not strictly necessary for the position. We have a
strong publication record and culture of producing open
data resources and open source software development.
This role requires an investigative and solution-oriented
mindset and excellent communication skills to work
eectively within large national and international con-
sortia.

UBern FishConservation
A technician position in sh ecology and conservation
is available (each 2-3 years) in the Aquatic Ecology &
Evolution group of Ole Seehausen at the University of
Bern, Switzerland
With the Wyss Academy for Nature, we are starting
an ambitious freshwater conservation biology project
with a focus on sh. Working initially at the scale of
the largest Swiss catchment, the Aare, home to more
than 60 dierent species of sh, we want to go all the
way from eld ecology, niche modelling and projections
of range shifts under climate change to identifying pri-
ority areas for biodiversity conservation, and designing
measures to mitigate predicted and recover past losses.
As implementation partner, the Swiss Fisheries Compe-
tence Center will develop applications of such measures
initially in a test region. The project is supported by
the Wyss Academy for Nature at the University of Bern
in partnership with the Canton of Bern and the Swiss
Federal Oce for the Environment (FOEN/Bafu). If
successful, the project may continue for up to eight
years, with the goals of upscaling projections to other
catchments of Switzerland and a fully edged mitigation
program.
The Aare catchment contains several of the large pe-
rialpine lakes, each of which has endemic species of
coldwater sh, several of which have already gone ex-
tinct. It also has many mountain rivers with environ-
mental gradients stretching from the arctic-alpine to
the temperate climate zone, including one of the most
pristine braided rivers left on the North face of the Alps.
We have an extensive data set on distribution records
for most species of sh in Switzerland and many envi-
ronmental variables. Our goal is to complement this
data with additional dense sampling of sh and envi-
ronmental variables across the entire Aare catchment.
Our recent work has uncovered old cryptic species as
well as postglacial ecological species within the broad
category of taxonomic \species" currently in use in man-agement. Whenever possible we will do niche modelling
and change projections at the level of these evolutionary
signicant units (ESUs). We will work with and add
to our large collection of voucher specimens and tissue
samples covering many populations of most Swiss sh
species. We will develop data rich niche models for
all species/ESUs of sh and also for some key aquatic
invertebrates. We will combine the niche models with
locally resolved climate and land-use change projections
to predict habitat gains and losses and identify hotspots
of expected biodiversity loss. We will use the results to
develop mitigation strategies, components of which will
be explored initially in a test region, in close collabora-
tion with the Swiss Fisheries Competence Centre, the
Wyss Academy for Nature, the Canton Bern oce for
the environment (LANAT) and the Federal Oce for
the Environment (FOEN).
We are hiring a technician to support a team of Post-
doctoral scientists. You are in charge of the sampling.
This includes electroshing and snorkelling in streams,
netshing, diving and ROV operations in lakes, pro-
cessing of samples and genetic lab work (barcoding and
RAD sequencing). You are also in charge of obtaining
sampling permits. Employment as technician/senior
technician depending on experience.
Qualications: MSc or PhD in sh biology with rele-
vant eld experience and strong technical skills. Social
skills and prociency in German/Swiss-German are re-
quired for interactions with sheries administrations
and stakeholders.
The project is part of the Hub Bern of the Wyss
Academy for Nature (https://www.wyssacademy.org/).
It will be implemented in close collaboration between the
Institute of Ecology & Evolution's division of Aquatic
Ecology & Evolution (https://www.iee.unibe.ch/), the
Swiss Fisheries Competence Centre, the Canton Bern of-
ce for the environment (LANAT), the Federal Oce for
the Environment (FOEN), and the Eawag Department
of Fish Ecology & Evolution.
The group of Seehausen is based at the Institute of
Ecology & Evolution of the University of Bern and at
the Eawag Centre for Ecology, Evolution & Biogeochem-
istry in Kastanienbaum (Lucerne). The group works on
the ecology, evolution and conservation of freshwater
sh with a strong focus on the sh of the Alpine region
and the African Great Lakes. The Postdocs and the
Technician in this project will function as a project team
within a much larger team of ecologists, evolutionary
biologists and conservationists. The group's working
language is English and uency in speaking and writ-
ing is required. Knowledge of German is also required
for the eld technician. Salary will be according to54 EvolDir May 1, 2021
University of Bern salary scheme and commensurate
with experience and job prole (e.g. responsibilities as
project manager). Supervisor: Prof. Dr. Ole Seehausen,

DataRequest
PollutionAndBirdColouration
*Data request - Inuence of anthropogenic pollution on
bird colouration.*
Dear colleagues,
We are conducting a research on the inuence of anthro-
pogenic pollution on dierent types of bird colouration,
including both feathers and bare-parts of skin. In this
study, we aim to estimate the scale of the problem and
to identify signicant knowledge gaps for better target-
ing of future research. Specically, we would like to
focus on two aspects:
- the impact of specic types of pollution (e.g. heavy
metals, *polychlorinated biphenyls* or radiation), prefer-
ably with a known concentration in the studied habitat
or bird's tissues, on the expression of colour traits.
- the inuence of urban environments on the expression
of colour traits, preferably in studies comparing birds
from urban vs rural/natural habitats.We are seeking the data from both correlative and ex-
perimental studies. Whenever possible, we would like
to request the raw data, with means, SE and sample
size, otherwise we also request for correlation and other
statistics from the models, together with sample sizes.
Examples of data we prefer are:
Dierences in colouration between control and pol-
luted/anthropogenic pressure treated groups
Correlation between pollution/anthropogenic factor and
colouration
We will consider all measures of colouration (spectropho-
tometric, photography-based, colour scoring).
If you have any kind of unpublished data, data from
PhD thesis, or from the upcoming articles, we will be
very thankful for possibility to include your ndings in
our study. We are waiting for the data until the 15th of
May.

FieldStation Participation Survey
Good morning/afternoon/evening,
Field stations and marine labs play a critical role in
enabling observations and experimental research to im-
prove our understanding of biological processes and to
monitor changing ecosystems. Field-based institutions
are a unique resource that presents numerous oppor-
tunities for the communication of scientic discovery
into education, public engagement, and policy. They
also pose unique challenges, including their often-remote
location, limited resources, and constrained communica-
tion. Through our anonymous survey, we aim to identify
factors that contribute to positive and negative student
experiences in order to create solutions that increase re-
tainment and promote equity at eld-based institutions
and marine labs.
If you have ever worked or participated in research at a
eld station or marine laboratory environment, please
consider lling out this anonymous survey HERE. The
survey will take 20-30 minutes to complete. Information
collected from this study will be kept condential and no
unique personal identifying information will be collected.
The survey will be open until May 1st, 2021.
Please consider distributing widely students and STEM60 EvolDir May 1, 2021
professionals (both academic and non-academic).
If you have any questions or concerns about the research,
you can contact Dr. Amy May at armay@ship.edu or
Victoria McDermott at vmmmcdermott@alaska.edu.
Our survey has been approved by Shippensburg Uni-
versity under IRB number 2373 for the involvement of
human subjects in our research.

JMolEvol ClassicPapers
EVOLDIR reported (March 4th) that for an issue cele-
brating the half century of the Journal of Molecular
Evolution, ten members of its editorial board each
gave their personal historical perspective on a clas-
sic paper from the journal and the research it subse-
quently spawned. These were made available at https:/-
/www.springer.com/journal/239/updates/18894136 to-
gether with links to the original paper referenced. One
of these classics (JME 44:632-636) described the epic
clash on the pages of the journal (1995) between the
neutralist ideas of Naboru Sueoka and the selectionist
ideas of Donald Forsdyke. The latter has now issued
an update (see Genetica 149(2):81-88; https://rdcu.be/-

Mediterranean SwordshSamples
Dear EvolDir community,
In the context of my environmental DNA post-doc I'm
looking for billsh tissues for a species-specicity testwith some probes we are going to use on our target
species; the swordsh, Xiphias gladius, in the Mediter-
ranean Sea. Specically we are looking for the most
relatives of the swordsh,which are the members of
Istiophoridae:
Istiompax indica Istiophorus albicans Istiophorus
platypterus Kajikia albida Kajikia audax Makaira
mazara Makaira nigricans Tetrapturus angustirostris
Tetrapturus belone Tetrapturus georgii Tetrapturus
puegeri
These tissues will help us to conduct the species-specity
test of our probes, and they will serve also as an out-
group. We hope to nd someone willing to share these
samples with us. One of each species would be sucient.
Together with Sophie Arnaud-Haond (Ifremer, Univer-
sity of Montpellier) we are ready to talk more about it,
just in case.

SexSpecic Fitness data
Dear Colleagues,
We are currently conducting a meta-analysis on sex-
specic tness responses to environmental stress. Specif-
ically, we aim to test whether the eects of environ-
mental stress (temperature, diet, pollution etc.) on
tness parameters (reproductive success, body mass
and lifespan) dier between males and females. Because
meta-analyses are often sensitive to publication bias,
we are looking for unpublished datasets that quantied
tness responses to stress of both sexes within the same

this research scholarship is to invest in early-career re-
searchers who are pursuing a career in climate-change
science. The topic is intentionally vague, and can in-
clude research into range-changes, evolution of adaptive
characteristics, etc. Be creative!
Who we are: Westarctica, Inc is a non-prot organi-
zation focused on advocating for global conservation,
framing conversations around Western Antarctica, an
uninhabited ecosystem with no political advocates. Con-
serving our polar ecosystems means many things reduc-
ing carbon use to halt warming and melting of polar ice,
learning to talk to people who deny the problem, and
researching better alternatives to virtually every aspect
of modern living.
Qualication: This research scholarship is available to
anyone who meets the following criteria: * pursuing
a graduate (Master PhD) in any nationally accredited
university or organization (i.e. zoo, eld station) in the
world. * researching a topic aligned with climate-change
or global conservation issues. * planning a research
project for the summer of 2020.
Application Procedure: Please ll out the application
linked on the webpage (https://www.westarctica.org/-
conservation-scholarship). You will be asked to answer
ve questions, each in 200 words or less (unless otherwise
specied): * In 20 words or less, describe the researchMay 1, 2021 EvolDir 65
question you are addressing. * What is the broad prob-
lem this question is addressing? * Why should the public
care about your question/the problem/your research? *
What possible solutions to climate-change might your
work propose? * How will this money improve your
research or the proposed solutions?
These applications will be reviewed by a panel of scien-
tically trained people from a variety of research and
conservation backgrounds, as well as Westarctica, Inc
board members. Finalists will be chosen, and the above
answers will be submitted to the active members of the
organization for a nal vote.
Important Dates: May 3, 2021 (5pm EST): Applications
Close May 10-14, 2021: Finalist selected and members
vote May 17, 2021: Winner Announced
Requirements: In accepting the award, you agree to
do one follow-up interview at the end of the research
period, and complete one short, online course on talking
about climate change to climate-deniers.Last year's winner: Abena Due Wiredu Bremang, a
doctoral student at the Kwame Nkrumah University of
Science and Technology in Ghana was selected as the
recipient of the 2020 Westarctica Conservation Scholar-
ship. She was previously honored as a UNESCO Young
Scientist in 2018 for her work on the eect of land use on
water quality in the Lake Bosomtwe Biosphere Reserve.
Abena will used the grant to further her research on the
hydrological impacts of climate change on water security
of the White Volta Basin. The White Volta Basin is
a transboundary region in West Africa shared between
the countries of Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Togo. The
Volta River and its tributaries provide water for many
rural communities who depend on it to support their
rural livelihoods.

DanishTechU
ComputationalPopulationGenetics
DTU Health Tech seeks qualied candidates for a vacant
postdoc position in computational population genetics
with a potential start date around September 1st 2021
(or according to mutual agreement).
In this position you will develop algorithms and com-
putational methods to deal with the analysis of large
datasets from modern and ancient sources. More specif-
ically, these algorithms will be aimed at analyzing a
large number of ancient genomes using population ge-
netics methods. The bioinformatics section of DTU
Health Tech performs research in the areas of dierent
metagenomics, machine learning, cancer genomics and
population genomics. Additional information should
be obtained by contacting the potential main super-
visor directly. The university is located in the greater
Copenhagen area, which is acknowledged for its excellent
standards of living, childcare and welfare system.
Current bioinformatics algorithms and software are of-
ten ill-equipped to deal with DNA extracted from an-
cient populations. This ancient DNA shows high levels
of fragmentation and accumulated chemical damage.
Furthermore, the number of individuals that can be se-
quences is often limited. Fortunately, several problems
pertaining to ancient DNA and ancient paleogenetics
can be described in a maximum-likelihood framework
and computer science techniques can help us to solve
such numerical problems eciently via machine learn-
ing, numerical algorithms and data structures. You
will work in collaboration with other partners including
the University of Copenhagen in order to develop the
next generation of algorithms and software applied to
DNA from fossils which can then be used to reconstruct
population history and infer selection.
Given the COVID19 pandemic, we will happily accom-
modate requests for remote work until in-person work
is deemed safe.
Qualications You must hold a PhD degree (or equiva-
lent) ideally in biological science with a focus on quanti-
tative and mathematical aspects, or in computer science
or mathematics.
The candidate we are looking for should ideally have
the following qualications:
* Knowledge of a programming language like Python,Perl, C++ and/or Java * Ability to work in a UNIX
environment, ideally in a high-performance computing
environment * Ideally, prociency in C/C++ or Java
or similar is a plus (not required) * Thorough under-
standing of basic principles of population genetics *
Knowledge of probabilities and statistics * Firm grasp
of rst-year university mathematics (dierential calcu-
lus/linear algebra) * Knowledge of coalescence theory
or diusion theory is an advantage * Expertise in next-
generation sequencing data generation and processing
are also a plus
The language of communication at DTU is English.
We oer DTU is a leading technical university globally
recognized for the excellence of its research, education,
innovation and scientic advice. We oer a rewarding
and challenging job in an international environment.
We strive for academic excellence in an environment
characterized by collegial respect and academic freedom
tempered by responsibility.
Application Your complete online application must be
submitted no later than 10 June 2021 (Danish time).

Project Description: We are building a team to create
a virtual rainforest: a general ecosystem model replicat-ing all physical and biotic components of the ecosystem
and their interactions, with a view to understanding
system-level emergent properties. The virtual rainforest
will link all of the biotic and abiotic system components
through nutrient cycling, stoichiometric and metabolic
processes. It will track the birth, growth and death of
cohorts of plant, animal and soil microbial functional
groups, and the movement of carbon, nitrogen, phos-
phorus, water and energy through the ecosystem. At its
heart, the virtual rainforest will be an individual-based
simulation of plants, animals, microbes and their inter-
actions with the abiotic environment, and which rests
upon the key individual-based processes of metabolism,
respiration, reproduction and mortality. The virtual
rainforest will be used to gain insight into the processes
that govern three key, emergent properties of rainforests:
their stability, resilience and sustainability.
Ecosystems cannot be understood through piecemeal
studies of their individual components. The disci-
pline of tropical forest ecology has at its disposal ever-
accumulating datasets examining all aspects of rain-
forest ecosystems giving insight into everything from
the population dynamics of plants through to the scav-
enging behaviour of ants. This knowledge allows us to
understand much of how the ecosystem operates and
the ecosystem services it generates, but in a disjointed
fashion. As a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Com-
putational Ecology, you will be part of an attempt to
tie that knowledge into a single, comprehensive under-
standing of how the ecosystem operates in its entirety.
Duties and responsibilities:
The primary role of successful applicants will be to de-
velop one of the four modules of the virtual rainforest:
plant, animal, soil microbial or abiotic processes. You
will be assisted in this by additional team members,
including your peers, a separately appointed scientic
programmer and postgraduate students. The project
provides a generous budget for placements and second-
ments to give you the freedom to work with, and harness
the expertise of, research groups beyond our own. The
virtual rainforest will lean heavily on data collected
from the SAFE Project (www.safeproject.net), and you
will be required to help with the management of these
datasets. All team members will be expected to help de-
velop the skills and competencies of their peers through
the sharing of tasks and knowledge. As part of a research
group and environment that extends beyond the virtual
rainforest team, you will contribute to the supervision
of undergraduate and postgraduate student projects.
You will be given time, resources and encouragement
to pursue your professional development, along with
opportunities to gain teaching experience in the form of
tutorials, lectures, practical classes and eld trips.70 EvolDir May 1, 2021
Essential requirements: We require team members who
provide complementary technical skills and disciplinary
knowledge, so applicants from any ecological background
and with any relevant skillset are encouraged to apply.
No individual team member is expected to have more
than a small subset of this list of topics and skills, and we
specically encourage applicants to clearly identify the
subset of skills that they could bring to the team. Among
the team members, we will need understanding of plant,
animal and microbial ecology, along with functional
ecology, metabolic ecology, ecological stoichiometry, bio-
geochemistry, hydrology and microclimate processes.
Candidates with an interest in systems ecology and the
concepts of stability, resilience and sustainability are
particularly encouraged to apply. Some programming
experience - preferably in Python - is necessary for all
applicants. Experience with either process-based or nu-
meric simulation modelling is desirable, as is experience
with error propagation and ecological statistics. We are
also seeking experience with version

LinkopingU EvolutionaryGenetics
Postdoctoral position in evolutionary biology/genetics
A postdoctoral position is available to work on an ERC-
funded project in the laboratory of Professor Dominic
Wright, in the Department of Biology at Link?ping
University, Sweden
For this position we are looking for a candidate with
a strong background in evolutionary genetics, quanti-
tative genetics and/or bioinformatics. The successful
candidate will be part of an interdisciplinary team of re-
searchers investigating the genomic basis of feralisation.
The project explores the molecular mechanisms under-
lying evolutionary transitions from domestication to
re-wilding (feralisation) using a series of feral chickens
derived from Hawaii and Bermuda. Using a power-
ful combination of genomics, transcriptomics, eld as-
says and laboratory experimental evolution the project
aims to reveal the genes and causal polymorphisms re-
sponsible for re-adaptation to a wild environment, and
how these progresses. The project will involve a large
amount of sequence data analysis, coming from single
cell sequencing data (including both sc RNAseq and sc
ATACseq data), as well as conventional whole genome
re-sequencing and RNA-seq data.
The candidate will work on various projects, but one of
the main ones will involve a combination of expression
and ATAC seq QTL analysis using the data generated
by single cell sequence data. In addition, selective sweep
mapping and other forms of population genetic analysis
will be performed. The candidate should therefore be
procient in some or all of these techniques or have
specialisation in at least one.
The project will perform Genome Wide Association
Mapping using a series of dierent populations of fer-
alised chickens (domestic birds that have escaped and
are now living wild throughout the Hawaiian Island
chain), in combination with a wild x domestic chicken
intercross to map the genes and polymorphisms under-
lying their rapid responses to newly imposed selectiveforces. In this instance the combination of integrating
both single cell expression QTL and single cell ATAC-
seq QTL will enable the identication of the genetic
basis of transcriptomic regulation occurring between
wild and domestic chickens down to the specic cell
type, whilst the simultaneous mapping of epigenomic
and transcriptomic data from the same nucleus should
also enable the identication of both the causal ele-
ments and causal genes for the regulatory machine in
the chicken hypothalamus. Similarly, sweep mapping
and other population genetic parameters will be assayed
in these feral populations to identify which regions are
most important in the response to selection in these
populations.
Representative papers for the populations to be used
can be found in the following articles: H?glund et
al. 2020 Nature Ecology and Evolution (https://-
doi.org/10.1038/s41559-020-01310-1), Johnsson et al.

genetics.115.179010) Johnsson et al. 2016 Nature
Communications 7, 1-11. (https://www.nature.com/-
articles/ncomms12950.pdf)
This is an exciting opportunity to combine a wide va-
riety of genomic and transcriptomic tools along with
the opportunity for eldwork and labwork as part of a
vibrant and friendly team.

dressing the mechanisms of adaptation and speciation in
a phytophagous species, the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon
pisum). This pest species is a model system in ecological
specialisation and speciation studies due to its complex
of plant-specialised biotypes that form a continuum of
divergence from closely related host races to incipient
species. The postdoc will be in charge of population
genomics approaches to explore the evolutionary history
of biotype formation and diversication in the pea aphid
complex. She/he will perform demographic inferences
to reconstruct the evolutionary and demographic history
of biotype diversication and genomic dierentiation
analyses to characterise loci involved in reproductive
isolation and the dynamics of genomic dierentiation
as speciation unfolds. Datasets made of >200 pooled
and individual resequenced genomes from worldwide
samples will be available at the start of the project and
will be expanded during the project. The project allows
for much exibility in the direction taken depending on
the postdoc's interests and ideas.
The position will be based at CBGP (Centre of biology
for the management of populations), Montferriez-sur-

2-year researcher/postdoc position on temperature adap-
tation in Littorina snails
We invite applications for a two-year researcher position
in evolutionary biology at the Faculty of Biosciences and
Aquaculture, Nord University (Bod, Norway). The po-
sition is available from 1 June 2021. Applications must
be submitted electronically (link below) by 2 May 2021.
The successful candidate will study the genomic basis
of temperature adaptation in the marine snail Littorina
saxatilis. Understanding how organisms adapt to their
environment at the genomic level is a major goal in
evolutionary biology; research on adaptation to local
climatic conditions obtains great urgency in times of an-
thropogenic climate change. L. saxatilis is an emerging
model system in evolutionary genomics and very suit-
able for studying temperature adaptation as it inhabits
a large range of climatic environments, which often vary
on small spatial scales.
The position will be part of an international project
funded by the Research Council of Norway focusing on
how temperature adaptation changes across space, e.g.
whether the same traits and loci contribute to adap-
tation to warm temperatures in dierent geographical
locations. Towards this goal, snail sampling across Eu-
rope will be combined with experimental and genomic
approaches.
The successful candidate will have documented enthusi-
asm for evolutionary research questions, a strong aca-
demic record, and the ability to work independently
while being part of a larger research team. Experience
in the analysis of large-scale genomic data sets is essen-
tial. Ideally the candidate will have experience in one
or more of the following areas: Quantitative genetics,
analysis of gene expression (RNAseq) data, biological
eld work, experimental work. We are looking for a76 EvolDir May 1, 2021
researcher with the motivation and experience to su-
pervise other members of the team. In addition, the
researcher is expected to organise part of the eldwork
and experimental work independently.
The postdoc will be part of an international
team of scientists across Europe (https://-
littorina.group.shef.ac.uk), connected by a common
interest in evolutionary processes and enthusiasm
for discussion, creativity and diversity in research.
The project will include work at the Tj arn o Marine

Postdoc: Modeling Gene Drive and Evolution of Insec-
ticide Resistance in Mosquitoes
OVERVIEW: We have funding from NIH for a project
titled \Combining Aedes aegypti genomics and modeling
to improve gene drive strategies and our understanding
of insecticide resistance evolution". Aedes aegypti is
the primary vector of dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and
urban yellow-fever. We are searching for a postdoc to
work on the modeling aspects of the project.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The idea of using self-
ish genetic elements to drive specic transgenes into
a mosquito population either to reduce its size or to
render it unable to transmit a particular pathogen was
proposed over 40 years ago. It is only recently, however,
with the advent of CRISPR-based gene editing tech-
nology, that this approach has gained broad attention
from researchers and the news media. The need for this
new technology is in part due to evolution of mosquito
resistance to insecticides.
The most straightforward approaches for building gene
drives using CRISPR/Cas9 technologies are theoreti-
cally expected to result in spread of the gene drive to
individuals in all populations that are connected by
even minimal gene ow. These approaches are appro-
priate in some cases, but detailed mathematical models
are needed to understand the dynamics of spread and
the potential for resistance evolving to the gene drive
mechanisms. Our group and others have proposed more
complex approaches for developing gene drives that are
spatially and/or temporally limited. Novel molecular
approaches accompanied by modeling are needed for
development of these limited gene drives.
We currently have a detailed spatial model that simu-
lates the population dynamics and population genetics
of Ae. aegypti in a city, Iquitos, in the Amazonian re-
gion of Peru. There are rich data sets on both mosquito
dynamics and dengue epidemiology that have been col-
lected in this city. One important characteristic of this
mosquito is limited among house movement and strong
population structure. A main goal of our NIH grant
is to modify this model to explore how and to what
extent population structure will impact insecticide resis-
tance evolution and the performance of novel gene driveMay 1, 2021 EvolDir 77

JOB DESCRIPTION: The postdoc in this position will
lead eorts on modifying the detailed model and uti-
lizing it to test hypotheses. The postdoc will have the
option of also conceptualizing and developing general
models to evaluate novel approaches for building spa-
tially/temporally limited gene drives. Our project is
strengthened by collaborations with a number of labs in
the US and in Peru, and activity in the Genetic Engi-
neering and Society Center at NC State that examines
societal aspects of novel genetic technologies. The post-
doc will interact with members of these other research
groups. If desired, there will be an opportunity for some
work in Peru and for mentoring undergraduate and grad-
uate students. The appointment is for two-years with
the potential to write new grants for extension beyond
that period.
QUALIFICATIONS: We are looking for a postdoc with
a solid background in population biology and popula-
tion genetics who has experience with modeling and who
wants to do applied research. Experience with C++ or
related languages is desirable. Ability to work indepen-
dently and to communicate eectively as a member of

Postdoc position: population genetics theory with high
mutation rate
A postdoc position is available with PI Joanna
Masel (http://www.eebweb.arizona.edu/faculty/masel/-
people/joanna/) at the University of Arizona in Tucson.
Being computational, the position is amenable to re-
mote work, and eorts will be made to accommodate all
situations. That said, collaboration with two in-Tucson
Ph.D. students is expected, and Tucson is located in
the biodiverse Sonoran desert, surrounded on all four
sides by mountainous national and state parks, with an
attractive climate for most of the year. Stipend is at
NIH rates, and the cost of living in Tucson is relatively
low.
The question we want to answer is, as Kondrashov put
it, \why have we not died 100 times over?" given the
estimated high (U >1) prevalence of deleterious muta-
tions https://doi.org/10.1006/jtbi.1995.0167. In current
simulations of realistically high genome-wide deleteri-
ous mutation rates, relative tness must constantly be
renormalized so as not to be overwhelmed by a Muller's
ratchet of xations of small eect size deleterious muta-
tions, even in large sexual populations.
We have devised a powerful new computational approach
that can capture realistic linkage as well as realistically
high population sizes and mutation rates for species
such as humans. This postdoc's rst task will be to
nish adapting our relative tness code to instead be
grounded in absolute tness. This will open up a variety
of questions about population viability / mutational
meltdown, reproductive compensation, and the best
approach to modeling epistasis, depending on interests.
Excellent computer programming skills are required, ide-
ally including both C and Python. Prior knowledge of
theoretical population genetics is preferred, although ex-
ceptionally strong computational scientists from highly
quantitative backgrounds outside evolutionary biology
will also be considered, as will non-theoreticians who can
demonstrate deep understanding of theoretical issues.
Start date is negotiable, and funding is secured through
December 2023.

UBern AfricanCichlidFishEvolution
Postdoc positions are available in the Aquatic Ecology
& Evolution group of Ole Seehausen at the University of
Bern and Eawag, Switzerland, to work on the Ecology
and Evolution of African Cichlid Fish.
The radiations of cichlid sh in the Great Lakes of
Africa created some of the largest known concentrations
of endemic species in record time. Hundreds of endemic
species evolved in less than 20'000 years in Lake Victo-
ria, possibly unparalleled among contemporary animals
elsewhere. The African cichlid sh are a great system
also for studying interactions between adaptive radi-
ation and ecosystems because complex new consumer
food webs have evolved, unparalleled by any other recent
species radiation. Unfortunately, African lake cichlids
also experienced the fastest large scale extinction event
ever observed by humans: about 200 endemic species
have disappeared in the past 40 years in Lake Victo-
ria. We study these sh in nature, breed them in our
aquarium systems and study their genomic diversity
and dierentiation. We have sequenced the complete
genomes of more than 250 species from Lake Victoria
and most other lakes in the region. Our long term goals
are to understand how this large radiation could emerge
so incredibly fast, how its evolution and its loss aect
the ecosystem, and what is required to safeguard diver-
sity amidst environmental change. It is a perfect study
system for anyone who wants to uncover the workings of
evolution, its interactions with ecology and its relevance
for nature conservation.
Because some of my recent Postdocs moved on to per-
manent positions, I am hiring new Postdocs. Fields ofinterest include evolutionary community ecology, island
biogeography, integrative taxonomy, functional morphol-
ogy, GWAS and QTL mapping, evolutionary genomics
of speciation, hybridization and adaptive radiation and
comparative phylogenomics.
Qualications: PhD in evolutionary biology or a similar
eld. Strong conceptual background in speciation, excel-
lent coding, data analysis and writing skills. Experience
with eldwork in tropical ecosystems and social skills for
interactions with sher folks and government authorities
and some knowledge of Kiswahili are assets.
Funding is for two years, but continuation for additional
years is strongly expected.
The Postdocs will also work closely with graduate stu-
dents in my group and with our Lake Victoria paleoe-
cology and aDNA team. The goal of the larger team
is to achieve a holistic understanding of evolutionary
diversication in an ecosystem context and to apply the
knowledge to conservation.
The team of Ole Seehausen is based at the Institute of
Ecology & Evolution of the University of Bern (https:/-
/www.iee.unibe.ch/) and at the Eawag Centre for Ecol-
ogy, Evolution & Biogeochemistry (CEEB; https://-
www.eawag.ch/en/department/shec/) in Kastanien-
baum (Lucerne) and we have labs and sh rooms in
both places. The Postdocs will become part of a large
team of ecologists, evolutionary biologists and conserva-
tion biologists. The larger group works on the ecology,
evolution and conservation of freshwater sh with a
strong focus on the sh of the African Great Lakes re-
gion, the Alpine region of Europe and Greenland. The
working language in the group, in the Institute of Ecol-
ogy and Evolution and at the Eawag CEEB is English.
Fluency in speaking and writing is required. Salary will
be according to University of Bern salary scheme and
commensurate with experience.
Because we work on African lakes, I wish to transfer sys-
tem knowledge to young scientists that want to commit
their career to the study and conservation of these sys-
tems. I therefore encourage applications from African
countries. Because of persistent gender, ethnic and cul-
tural biases in ecology, evolution and conservation, I
especially encourage applications from women and sci-
entists identifying as belonging to ethnic and cultural
groups that are underrepresented in ecology, evolution
and conservation.
Supervisor: Prof. Ole Seehausen, Institute of Ecol-

initially in a test region. The project is supported by
the Wyss Academy for Nature at the University of Bern
in partnership with the Canton of Bern and the Swiss
Federal Oce for the Environment (FOEN/Bafu). If
successful, the project may continue for up to eight
years, with the goals of upscaling projections to other
catchments of Switzerland and a fully edged mitigation
program.
The Aare catchment contains several of the large pe-
rialpine lakes, each of which has endemic species of
coldwater sh, several of which have already gone ex-
tinct. It also has many mountain rivers with environ-
mental gradients stretching from the arctic-alpine to
the temperate climate zone, including one of the most
pristine braided rivers left on the North face of the Alps.
We have an extensive data set on distribution records
for most species of sh in Switzerland and many envi-
ronmental variables. Our goal is to complement this
data with additional dense sampling of sh and envi-
ronmental variables across the entire Aare catchment.
Our recent work has uncovered old cryptic species as
well as postglacial ecological species within the broadcategory of taxonomic \species" currently in use in man-
agement. Whenever possible we will do niche modelling
and change projections at the level of these evolutionary
signicant units (ESUs). We will work with and add
to our large collection of voucher specimens and tissue
samples covering many populations of most Swiss sh
species. We will develop data rich niche models for
all species/ESUs of sh and also for some key aquatic
invertebrates. We will combine the niche models with
locally resolved climate and land-use change projections
to predict habitat gains and losses and identify hotspots
of expected biodiversity loss. We will use the results to
develop mitigation strategies, components of which will
be explored initially in a test region, in close collabora-
tion with the Swiss Fisheries Competence Centre, the
Wyss Academy for Nature, the Canton Bern oce for
the environment (LANAT) and the Federal Oce for
the Environment (FOEN).

aprecruit.berkeley.edu/JPF02935 There is an opening
for a Postdoctoral position to study conservation and
population genomics of mammals as part of the Cali-
fornia Conservation Genomics Project (CCGP) in the
lab of Professor Michael Nachman in the Museum ofVertebrate Zoology at UC Berkeley. The California Con-
servation Genomics Project (CCGP) is a state-funded
initiative with the goal of producing the most compre-
hensive, multispecies, genomic dataset ever assembled
to help manage regional biodiversity. More information
about this statewide eort can be found here: https://-
www.ccgproject.org/. This position will involve bioin-
formatic analysis of whole-genome sequences from 750
individual mammal specimens representing 15 species.
The primary goal of this project is to generate a map
of genetic diversity for these 15 species across Cali-
fornia. We are also interested in inferring historical
demographic changes, assessing the extent to which se-
lection has shaped patterns of genomic variation, and
linking genotype to phenotype for traits of interest. The
ideal candidate will have a strong background in popula-
tion, conservation, or landscape genomics and signicant
experience in the analysis of large genomic datasets.
Research in the Nachman lab (https://-
www.nachmanlab.org/) focuses on population,
evolutionary, and ecological genetics and genomics. We
are broadly interested in the genetic basis of evolu-
tionary change, including the genetics of adaptation
and the genetic basis of speciation. For example, we
are interested in uncovering signatures of selection in
patterns of DNA sequence variation and in linking
specic genetic changes to specic adaptive phenotypes.
Much of the current work centers on the genetic basis
of adaptation to dierent environments. Our research
utilizes a wide range of methods and approaches
including eld studies, genetic crosses in the laboratory,
tools of molecular biology, genomics, and bioinformatics
analyses of large datasets.

EvolutionaryComparativeGenomics
Postdoctoral Position in Evolutionary Population and
Comparative Genomics
A postdoctoral position is available to work on an NSF-
funded project in the laboratory of Professor Carol Lee,
in the Department of Integrative Biology at the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin, Madison.
This project focuses on Rapid Evolutionary Responses
to Global Change using the copepod Eurytemora anis
species complex as a model system. With changes in
global climate, coastal high latitude waters are expe-
riencing rapid declines in salinity, due to increases in
ice melt and precipitation. We have found evolutionary
shifts in ion transport function, genome-wide gene ex-
pression, and population genomic signatures of selection
associated with changes in salinity (see pubs in the links
below). This postdoc project will entail conducting
comparative genomic and population genomic analyses
associated with temperature and salinity change in wild
and laboratory populations.
The E. anis complex presents an exemplary model,
with its short generation time (20d), ease of culturing
large numbers (thousands per population), and ability
to generate inbred lines. The Lee Lab is generating
multiple full reference genomes (PacBio and Oxford
Nanopore) from the E. anis species complex to the
chromosome level. Additionally, the multiple indepen-
dent environmental clines have enabled us to observe
exceptional cases of parallel polygenetic adaptation (to
the level of SNPs).
The ideal candidate should hold a Ph.D. and have pub-
lications in peer-reviewed journals. A background in
evolutionary genetics is required, especially in popula-
tion genetics/genomics or comparative genomics. Rele-
vant areas of expertise include molecular evolutionarygenetics, computational and programming skills, and
statistics.
Review of applications will begin immediately and will
continue until the position is lled. The appointment
could persist for up to three years. Interested candi-
dates should email their application to Prof. Carol Lee
(carollee@wisc.edu), including: (1) a CV, (2) a list of
references (recommenders), and (3) samples of rst au-
thored publications. Enquiries regarding this position
are most welcome.
The University of Wisconsin-Madison oers a large
and intellectually vibrant community of evolution-
ary/population biologists, providing ample opportuni-
ties for interaction with excellent scientists (see https:/-
/evolution.wisc.edu/people/faculty/) and rst rate de-
partments of Statistics and Biostatistics, computational
facilities, and a Biotech Center. Madison is a culturally-
rich community, in relative close proximity to Chicago.

Postdoctoral Position in Evolutionary Population and
Comparative Genomics
A postdoctoral position is available to work on an NSF-
funded project in the laboratory of Professor Carol Lee,
in the Department of Integrative Biology at the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin, Madison.
This project focuses on Rapid Evolutionary Responses
to Global Change using the copepod Eurytemora anis
species complex as a model system. With changes in
global climate, coastal high latitude waters are expe-
riencing rapid declines in salinity, due to increases in
ice melt and precipitation. We have found evolutionaryMay 1, 2021 EvolDir 97
shifts in ion transport function, genome-wide gene ex-
pression, and population genomic signatures of selection
associated with changes in salinity (see pubs in the links
below). This postdoc project will entail conducting
comparative genomic and population genomic analyses
associated with temperature and salinity change in wild
and laboratory populations.
The E. anis complex presents an exemplary model,
with its short generation time (20d), ease of culturing
large numbers (thousands per population), and ability
to generate inbred lines. The Lee Lab is generating
multiple full reference genomes (PacBio and Oxford
Nanopore) from the E. anis species complex to the
chromosome level. Additionally, the multiple indepen-
dent environmental clines have enabled us to observe
exceptional cases of parallel polygenetic adaptation (to
the level of SNPs).
The ideal candidate should hold a Ph.D. and have pub-
lications in peer-reviewed journals. A background in
evolutionary genetics is required, especially in popula-
tion genetics/genomics or comparative genomics. Rele-
vant areas of expertise include molecular evolutionary
genetics, computational and programming skills, and
statistics.
Review of applications will begin immediately and will
continue until the position is lled. The appointment
could persist for up to three years. Interested candi-
dates should email their application to Prof. Carol Lee
(carollee@wisc.edu), including: (1) a CV, (2) a cover
letter describing qualications and relevant experience,
(3) a list of references (recommenders), and (4) samples
of rst authored publications. Enquiries regarding this
position are most welcome.
The University of Wisconsin-Madison oers a large
and intellectually vibrant community of evolution-
ary/population biologists, providing ample opportuni-
ties for interaction with excellent scientists (see https:/-
/evolution.wisc.edu/people/faculty/) and rst rate de-
partments of Statistics and Biostatistics, computational
facilities, and a Biotech Center. Madison is a culturally-
rich community, in relative close proximity to Chicago.

nph.15529) and the genetic analysis of host determi-
nants in the mildew pathogen (M ^A^A1ller et al., unpub-
lished). Based on the pathogen analysis, corresponding
genes involved in non-host resistance will be identied
using mutagenesis and mutant chromosome sequenc-
ing (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13059-
016-1082-1). Functional analysis will include studies
in wheat and Triticale as well as in the heterologous
N. benthamiana system. For recent publications in the
group also see: scholar.google.com/ (Beat Keller).
Requirements and requested skills: - Proven experience
(including publications in international well recognized
journals) in evolutionary genetics or molecular biology,
ideally in the eld of host pathogen interactions. -
Strong bioinformatic background to handle large ge-
nomic sequencing datasets. Programming skills (e.g.
Python) are preferred. - Experience in phytopathol-
ogy is desirable but not essential. - Ability to frame
questions and to test them experimentally and bioinfor-
matically. - Writing skills for scientic publications. -
Very good English communication skills and ability to
both work in a team and individually.
Starting date: Ideally, early Summer 2021 (position is
open immediately), but given the current situation we
are exible. The position is available for 2-3 years. The

The course is structured in modules over ve days. Each
day will include introductory lectures with class discus-
sions of key concepts. The remainder of each day will
consist of practical hands-on sessions. These sessions
will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises
with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as well asapplying these skills on your own to complete individual
exercises. After and during each exercise, results will
be interpreted and discussed in group.
TARGETED AUDIENCE & ASSUMED BACK-
GROUND
The course is aimed at students, researchers and profes-
sionals interested in learning the dierent steps involved
in a GWAS study using them to build a structured
pipeline for semi-automated and reproducibile GWAS
analyses. It will include information useful for both
beginners and more advanced users. We will start by
introducing general concepts of GWAS and bioinfor-
matics pipeline building, progressively describing all
steps and putting there seamlessy together in a general
workow. Attendees should have a background in biol-
ogy, specically genetics; previous exposure to GWAS
experiments would also be benecial. There will be a
mix of lectures and hands-on practical exercises using
R, Linux command line and custom software. Some
basic understanding of R programming and Unix will be
advantageous. Attendees should also have some basic
familiarity with genomic data such as those arising from
NGS experiments.

Dear colleagues,
Transmitting Science is oering a new course: Introduc-
tion to Geographic Analyses of Biodiversity.
Dates and schedule: May 24th-28th, 2021. Online live
sessions from Monday to Friday from 15:00 to 17:00 and
from 19:00 to 21:00 (GMT+2, Madrid time zone).May 1, 2021 EvolDir 103
Instructors: Miriam Zelditch (University of Michigan,
USA), Donald Swidersky (University of Michigan, USA)
and Pascal Title (Stony Brook University, USA)
Course overview:
In this course instructors will introduce dierent con-
ceptual biological reasons why it might be interesting
to examine biodiversity data in a geographic context,
focusing on the relationships between species richness,
trait similarity and phylogeny, as well as patterns of
turnover in those relationships. In this overview, they
will discuss what these can reveal about patterns of
community assembly, in situ diversication vs immi-
gration, as well as the potential connections between
these patterns and environmental/climatic/elevational
gradients.
In this workshop, instructors will cover how to ob-
tain the various types of data (geographic, environ-
mental/climatic and elevation; morphological and phy-
logenetic), how to work with them in R, the metrics of
diversity, and how to map them for purposes of visu-
alization and how to conduct the statistical analyses,
taking geography into account.
This workshop is primarily intended for (but is not ex-
clusive to) graduate students and postdocs with a degree
in biological sciences.
The instructors will supply datasets but participants
are encouraged to bring (or download) geographic infor-
mation, phylogeny and morphological data.

Dear all,
registrations are now open for the Physalia course on
\INTRODUCTION TO DEEP LEARNING FOR BIOL-
OGISTS", which will be held online from the 20th to
the 24th of September
Course website:( https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/course67/ )
The course is aimed at advanced students, researchers
and professionals interested in learning what deep learn-
ing is and how to develop a deep learning model for
applications in biology. It will include information useful
for both absolute beginners and more advanced users
willing to delve into some aspects of the implementation
of deep learning. We will start by introducing general
concepts of deep learning presenting a functioning model
and then we will progressively describe the main building
blocks of a deep learning model and how the internal
machinery works. Attendees are expected to have a
background in biology and the research problems involv-
ing prediction, inference, pattern discovery; previous
exposure to predictive experiments would be benecial.
There will be a mix of lectures and hands-on practical
exercises using mainly Python, Jupyter Notebooks and
the Linux command line. Some basic understanding of
Python programming and the Linux environment will
be advantageous, but is not required.
Learning outcomes
At the end of the course the student will have an under-
standing of:May 1, 2021 EvolDir 105
- the basic theoretical background of deep learning, both
in terms of basic building blocks and of commonly used,
state-of-the-art architectures
- dierences between classication, regression, segmen-
tation, and how to frame a real-world problem in terms
of these classes
- the main steps involved in building a deep learning
model for prediction problems in biology, comprising
how to evaluate prediction accuracy and how to compare
and choose dierent models
- how to use real-world data for statistical learning,
comprising data preparation and data augmentation

Online WholeGenomeSequencing
Oct11-14
Dear all,
registrations are now open for the 2nd edition of the
Physalia-course \Population genomic inference from low-
coverage whole-genome sequencing data", which will be
delivered remotely in October (11th-14th).
Instructors: Dr. Nina Overgaard Therkildsen (Cornell
University, USA) and Dr. Matteo Fumagalli (Imperial
College London, UK)
Course website: ( https://www.physalia-courses.org/-
courses-workshops/course64/ )
In this course, we will explore workows and the underly-
ing rationale behind producing, processing, and analyz-
ing low-coverage sequencing data for population genomicinference. Given that most species have insucient refer-
ence data to allow reliable genotype imputation, we will
focus on genotype likelihood-based methodology that
can be applied to any system. We will primarily cover
methods and algorithms implemented in the ANGSD
software package and associated programs, providing
best-practice guidelines and discussion of how partic-
ipants can make maximal use of low-coverage whole
genome re-sequencing data for their studies.
The course is aimed at researchers who might have pre-
vious experience with next generation sequencing (NGS)
data (e.g. exome/RAD/pooled sequencing) and wish
to explore the potential for using low-coverage whole-
genome sequencing for their studies.
All hands-on exercises will be run in a Linux environ-
ment on remote servers. Statistical analyses and data
visualization will be run in R.

Instructions
Instructions: To be added to the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. At
this time provide a binary six letter code that determines which messages will be mailed to you. These are listed
in the same order as presented here | Conferences; Graduate Student Positions; Jobs; Other; Post-doctoral
positions; WorkshopsCourses. For example to receive the listings that concern conferences and post-doctoral
positions this would be 100010. Messages are categorized on the basis of their subject headings. If this subject
heading is not successfully parsed, the message will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. In addition, if it
originates from `blackballed' addresses it will be sent to me at Golding@McMaster.CA. These messages will only
be read and dealt with when I have time. The code 000000 has all channels turned o and hence gets only a once
monthly notifcation of the availability of a monthly review pdf le.
To be removed from the EvolDir mailing list please send an email message to Golding@McMaster.CA. Note that
`on vacation', etc, style messages are automatically ltered and should not be transmitted to the list (I hope), but
should you wish to avoid the e-mail's your code can be temporarily changed to 000000.
To send messages to the EvolDir direct them to the email evoldir@evol.biology.McMaster.CA. Do not include
encoded attachments and do not send it as Word les, as HTML les, as L ATEX les, Excel les, etc. . . . plain old
ASCII will work great and can be read by everyone. Add a subject header that contains the correct category
\Conference:, Graduate position:, Job:, Other:, Postdoc:, Workshop:" and then the message stands a better chance
of being correctly parsed. Note that the colon is mandatory.
The message will be stored until the middle of the night (local time). At a predetermined time, the collected
messages will be captured and then processed by programs and lters. If the message is caught by one of the
lters (e.g. a subject header is not correctly formated) the message will be send to me at Golding@McMaster.CA
and processed later. In either case, please do not expect an instant response.
AfterwordMay 1, 2021 EvolDir 109
This program is an attempt to automatically process a broad variety of e-mail messages. Most preformating is collapsed to save
space. At the current time, many features may be incorrectly handled and some email messages may be positively mauled. Although
this is being produced by L ATEX do not try to embed L ATEX or T EX in your message (or other formats) since my program will strip
these from the message.
